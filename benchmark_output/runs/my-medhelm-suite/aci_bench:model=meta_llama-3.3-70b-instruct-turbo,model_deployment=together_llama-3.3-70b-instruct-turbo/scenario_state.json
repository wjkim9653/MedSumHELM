HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS**\nThe patient is a 62-year-old male with a past medical history significant for reflux. He presents for follow-up of his chronic problems. The patient reports that he has been doing well since starting Protonix for his reflux, with significant improvement in his symptoms. He has been able to eat whatever he wants without discomfort and has made lifestyle modifications, including switching from caffeine to green tea and reducing his intake of spicy foods and alcohol.\n\n**2. PHYSICAL EXAM**\nThe patient's vital signs are within normal limits, with good blood pressure and heart rate control. On physical examination, there are no carotid bruits in the neck. A slight 2/6 systolic ejection murmur is heard, which is stable. The lungs are clear, and there is 1+ pitting edema bilaterally in the lower extremities, likely due to fluid retention from standing all day.\n\n**3. RESULTS**\nThe patient's endoscopy results from last year showed mild gastritis, which is consistent with his history of reflux. The patient has been taking Protonix 40 mg daily, which has been effective in managing his symptoms.\n\n**4. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN**\nThe patient's reflux is well-controlled on Protonix 40 mg daily, and he is advised to continue this medication and maintain his lifestyle modifications, including dietary changes. The patient is also encouraged to exercise regularly to help with fluid retention. The patient has no questions or concerns and is scheduled for follow-up as needed. The nurse will check the patient out and provide any further instructions.",

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS**\nThe patient is a 62-year-old male with a past medical history significant for reflux. He presents for follow-up of his chronic problems. The patient reports that he has been doing well since starting Protonix for his reflux, with significant improvement in his symptoms. He has been able to eat whatever he wants without discomfort and has made lifestyle modifications, including switching from caffeine to green tea and reducing his intake of spicy foods and alcohol.\n\n**2. PHYSICAL EXAM**\nThe patient's vital signs are within normal limits, with good blood pressure and heart rate control. On physical examination, there are no carotid bruits in the neck. A slight 2/6 systolic ejection murmur is heard, which is stable. The lungs are clear, and there is 1+ pitting edema bilaterally in the lower extremities, likely due to fluid retention from standing all day.\n\n**3. RESULTS**\nThe patient's endoscopy results from last year showed mild gastritis, which is consistent with his history of reflux. The patient has been taking Protonix 40 mg daily, which has been effective in managing his symptoms.\n\n**4. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN**\nThe patient's reflux is well-controlled on Protonix 40 mg daily, and he is advised to continue this medication and maintain his lifestyle modifications, including dietary changes. The patient is also encouraged to exercise regularly to help with fluid retention. The patient has no questions or concerns and is scheduled for follow-up as needed. The nurse will check the patient out and provide any further instructions.\n</response>\nThe reference note will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nCHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nFollow-up chronic problems.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nAlexander Myers is a 62-year-old male with a past medical history significant for reflux who presents for follow-up of his chronic problems.\n\nIn regards to his reflux, he reports that he has continued to utilize Protonix 40 mg daily. He states this has helped a lot and he is really comfortable. The patient is doing really well with his diet. He reports that he has discontinued drinking energy drinks and is now drinking green tea. The patient states this change has also helped reduce his side effects.\n\nHe notes that his reflux being improved has helped his mood. The patient has a good support system at home and all of his children call to check on him daily. He also notes his job is going well.\n\nThe patient denies chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\n\u2022 Cardiovascular: Denies chest pain or dyspnea on exertion.\n\u2022 Respiratory: Denies shortness of breath\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION\n\n\u2022 Neurological/Psychological: Appropriate mood and affect.\n\u2022 Neck: No carotid bruits appreciable.\n\u2022 Respiratory: Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.

significant alcohol use disorder and mi- mild hypercholesterolemia . at last visit on april 16th her blood pressure was 130 over 90 . after presenting at 150 over 100 she was prescribed hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 milligrams by mouth once daily , and lisinopril 20 milligrams by mouth once daily . cmp and cbc were essentially unremarkable .\n[doctor] hi miss taylor , how are you today ?\n[patient] hi , i'm- i'm good , thank you .\n[doctor] thanks for coming in today .\n[patient] yeah , no problem .\n[doctor] so how have things been going for you ?\n[patient] uh , they've been all right . i'm struggling with not drinking . i wanted to discuss that , uh , shot that you had mentioned last time , but we did n't get to discuss it too much .\n[doctor] okay , well i'll be happy to provide you with more information . so tell me when did you last have a drink ?\n[patient] on monday .\n[doctor] okay , so you've gone a couple days without it ?\n[patient] yeah , yeah i have .\n[doctor] yeah , and had you been drinking for a while ?\n[patient] yep .\n[doctor] how much had- how much had you been drinking ?\n[patient] um , four or five times a week hard alcohol , so , you know .\n[doctor] okay . well it will certainly help your blood pressure if you're able to stop drinking .\n[patient] yeah , yeah i- i- i agree with you .\n[doctor] okay . are you taking your blood pressure medications ?\n[patient] yeah , but i'm only taking half of the lisinopril .\n[doctor] okay .\n[patient] i- b- well , the first time i took it i felt lethargic and tired , so i only took a half dose the next time . i felt much better and i did n't have the headaches or the swooshing that started in my left ear . so i feel like it's definitely helping but i do n't know ... i know it's not gon na be okay until i stop drinking .\n[doctor] and are you also taking the full dose of the hydrochlorothiazide ? do you have any , um , chest tightness or pressure or any shortness of breath ?\n[patient] yeah i'm taking the full dose of that medicine too , and no none of those symptoms .\n[doctor] okay . anything else i should be aware of or that we should be checking ?\n[patient] mm , no .\n[doctor] okay , good . are you doing the blood pressure checks at home ?\n[patient] yes . yes i am .\n[doctor] okay good . what kind of numbers are you seeing ?\n[patient] well , in the morning i'm seeing lower numbers than in the evening , um , where i run anywhere from like 130 to 145 or 150 over 95 to 100 on the bottom .\n[doctor] okay .\n[patient] but in the evenings if i sit there for a while and then take it , it goes down . kind of like when i come here it's always high but then it goes down . in the mornings it's generally more normal where it's supposed to be .\n[doctor] uh- .\n[patient] mm , also i'm taking my medicine in the morning when i get up instead of in the evening .\n[doctor] yeah , so it sounds like we are not too far out of where we wan na be .\n[patient] right , mm-hmm .\n[doctor] okay . well let me get a listen to your heart , go ahead and hop up here .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] use my general exam template . all right , go ahead and take some deep breaths . okay , good . any fever , cough , shortness of breath or sore throat ?\n[patient] no .\n[doctor] any recent travel or contact or exposure to the coronavirus ?\n[patient] nope .\n[doctor] have you received your coronavirus vaccine ?\n[patient] yes , on february 9th .\n[doctor] okay , great . all right well i'm just going to look at your ankles and feet , i'm looking for any signs of swelling .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] all right , well everything looks good . you can go ahead and sit up miss taylor . all right , so the good news is everything is looking okay . i think we both agree if you were able to stop drinking your blood pressure would cease to be an issue for you .\n[patient] yeah i agree with that .\n[doctor] so let us discuss the potential medicine to help you with that . what it does is it blocks some of the brain receptors that alcohol stimulates and it tricks the brain into thinking it does not need alcohol , thereby cutting down the urges .\n[patient] the urge to drink or the constant thinking about it ?\n[doctor] it actually will help with both .\n[patient] okay . so is it like a one-time thing ?\n[doctor] generally the shot is given about once a month , it can also be given as a daily pill , but the shot does tend to work a bit better .\n[patient] yeah i've taken things like this in the past and if it is a pill , i know i wo n't take it . with a shot , it's not like you can un-take it .\n[doctor] yeah that's true . and the shot has been shown to work , it is more just a matter of getting you in to get your shot a month later with the nurse .\n[patient] yeah , sure , sure .\n[doctor] okay , so it's called naltrexone . i think the other name might be vivitrol . like i've said , the research on it is pretty good .\n[patient] i think i may have taken the naltrexone before .\n[doctor] okay , yeah , maybe you have .\n[patient] yeah , if it was available in a pill form then i'm almost certain i've tried it b- before .\n[doctor] okay . if this sounds good though , we can go ahead get you started with the shot . i am looking and it looks like we have you coming back in on may 17th for your first shot , does that sound good ?\n[patient] yeah , yeah , that sounds great . are there any possible side effects ?\n[doctor] yeah , some people will experience some nausea , headache , dizziness , anxi- anxiety , tiredness and trouble sleeping , but generally the side effects are mild and should go away within a few days .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] then we can schedule you for a follow-up in june to see how you are doing .\n[patient] all right that sounds good .\n[doctor] all right great . well otherwise stay with your current medicines , keep checking your blood pressure , and let's see if we can stop the alcohol for good . let us know if you have any questions or any issues come up after you receive the first dose .\n[patient] all right , sounds good , thank you .\n[doctor] you are welcome , have a good rest of your day .\n[patient] you too .\n[doctor] miss taylor is drinking alcohol four to five days per week to excess . no tobacco , no substance abuse , skin is moist , good trigger . on exam she is alert , pleasant , in no acute distress . she is not diabetic , there is no tremor , no cva tenderness , chest clear to percussion and auscultation , unlabored breathing , cardiac rhythm regular , no murmur , no gallop , jvp flat , with a head at 90 degrees . she does not appear anxious , agitated or depressed . my impression , alcohol use disorder . she would like to start naltrexone which we have previously discussed . she will take the injectable form and start on may 17th . we reviewed side effects and risks . the potential benefit of alcohol cessation would be highly beneficial to her for many reasons . hypertension , she is taking lisinopril 10 milligrams daily and hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 milligrams daily . quite possibly her blood pressure will improve completely with cessation of alcohol . her target bp is 130 to 140 over 70 to 80 . i will see her back week of june 14th , which is likely around the time of her second naltrexone injection . i recommend upgrading influenza

?\n[patient] uh , they've been all right . i'm struggling with not drinking . i wanted to discuss that , uh , shot that you had mentioned last time , but we did n't get to discuss it too much .\n[doctor] okay , well i'll be happy to provide you with more information . so tell me when did you last have a drink ?\n[patient] on monday .\n[doctor] okay , so you've gone a couple days without it ?\n[patient] yeah , yeah i have .\n[doctor] yeah , and had you been drinking for a while ?\n[patient] yep .\n[doctor] how much had- how much had you been drinking ?\n[patient] um , four or five times a week hard alcohol , so , you know .\n[doctor] okay . well it will certainly help your blood pressure if you're able to stop drinking .\n[patient] yeah , yeah i- i- i agree with you .\n[doctor] okay . are you taking your blood pressure medications ?\n[patient] yeah , but i'm only taking half of the lisinopril .\n[doctor] okay .\n[patient] i- b- well , the first time i took it i felt lethargic and tired , so i only took a half dose the next time . i felt much better and i did n't have the headaches or the swooshing that started in my left ear . so i feel like it's definitely helping but i do n't know ... i know it's not gon na be okay until i stop drinking .\n[doctor] and are you also taking the full dose of the hydrochlorothiazide ? do you have any , um , chest tightness or pressure or any shortness of breath ?\n[patient] yeah i'm taking the full dose of that medicine too , and no none of those symptoms .\n[doctor] okay . anything else i should be aware of or that we should be checking ?\n[patient] mm , no .\n[doctor] okay , good . are you doing the blood pressure checks at home ?\n[patient] yes . yes i am .\n[doctor] okay good . what kind of numbers are you seeing ?\n[patient] well , in the morning i'm seeing lower numbers than in the evening , um , where i run anywhere from like 130 to 145 or 150 over 95 to 100 on the bottom .\n[doctor] okay .\n[patient] but in the evenings if i sit there for a while and then take it , it goes down . kind of like when i come here it's always high but then it goes down . in the mornings it's generally more normal where it's supposed to be .\n[doctor] uh- .\n[patient] mm , also i'm taking my medicine in the morning when i get up instead of in the evening .\n[doctor] yeah , so it sounds like we are not too far out of where we wan na be .\n[patient] right , mm-hmm .\n[doctor] okay . well let me get a listen to your heart , go ahead and hop up here .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] use my general exam template . all right , go ahead and take some deep breaths . okay , good . any fever , cough , shortness of breath or sore throat ?\n[patient] no .\n[doctor] any recent travel or contact or exposure to the coronavirus ?\n[patient] nope .\n[doctor] have you received your coronavirus vaccine ?\n[patient] yes , on february 9th .\n[doctor] okay , great . all right well i'm just going to look at your ankles and feet , i'm looking for any signs of swelling .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] all right , well everything looks good . you can go ahead and sit up miss taylor . all right , so the good news is everything is looking okay . i think we both agree if you were able to stop drinking your blood pressure would cease to be an issue for you .\n[patient] yeah i agree with that .\n[doctor] so let us discuss the potential medicine to help you with that . what it does is it blocks some of the brain receptors that alcohol stimulates and it tricks the brain into thinking it does not need alcohol , thereby cutting down the urges .\n[patient] the urge to drink or the constant thinking about it ?\n[doctor] it actually will help with both .\n[patient] okay . so is it like a one-time thing ?\n[doctor] generally the shot is given about once a month , it can also be given as a daily pill , but the shot does tend to work a bit better .\n[patient] yeah i've taken things like this in the past and if it is a pill , i know i wo n't take it . with a shot , it's not like you can un-take it .\n[doctor] yeah that's true . and the shot has been shown to work , it is more just a matter of getting you in to get your shot a month later with the nurse .\n[patient] yeah , sure , sure .\n[doctor] okay , so it's called naltrexone . i think the other name might be vivitrol . like i've said , the research on it is pretty good .\n[patient] i think i may have taken the naltrexone before .\n[doctor] okay , yeah , maybe you have .\n[patient] yeah , if it was available in a pill form then i'm almost certain i've tried it b- before .\n[doctor] okay . if this sounds good though , we can go ahead get you started with the shot . i am looking and it looks like we have you coming back in on may 17th for your first shot , does that sound good ?\n[patient] yeah , yeah , that sounds great . are there any possible side effects ?\n[doctor] yeah , some people will experience some nausea , headache , dizziness , anxi- anxiety , tiredness and trouble sleeping , but generally the side effects are mild and should go away within a few days .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] then we can schedule you for a follow-up in june to see how you are doing .\n[patient] all right that sounds good .\n[doctor] all right great . well otherwise stay with your current medicines , keep checking your blood pressure , and let's see if we can stop the alcohol for good . let us know if you have any questions or any issues come up after you receive the first dose .\n[patient] all right , sounds good , thank you .\n[doctor] you are welcome , have a good rest of your day .\n[patient] you too .\n[doctor] miss taylor is drinking alcohol four to five days per week to excess . no tobacco , no substance abuse , skin is moist , good trigger . on exam she is alert , pleasant , in no acute distress . she is not diabetic , there is no tremor , no cva tenderness , chest clear to percussion and auscultation , unlabored breathing , cardiac rhythm regular , no murmur , no gallop , jvp flat , with a head at 90 degrees . she does not appear anxious , agitated or depressed . my impression , alcohol use disorder . she would like to start naltrexone which we have previously discussed . she will take the injectable form and start on may 17th . we reviewed side effects and risks . the potential benefit of alcohol cessation would be highly beneficial to her for many reasons . hypertension , she is taking lisinopril 10 milligrams daily and hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 milligrams daily . quite possibly her blood pressure will improve completely with cessation of alcohol . her target bp is 130 to 140 over 70 to 80 . i will see her back week of june 14th , which is likely around the time of her second naltrexone injection . i recommend upgrading influenza vaccination and shingrix . number two , she did defer this .\n\nClinical Note:",

            "text": "Here is a clinical note with four sections based on the conversation:\n\n**1. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS**\nAmanda Taylor, a 72-year-old woman, presents for follow-up on her hypertension. She has a history of significant alcohol use disorder and mild hypercholesterolemia. At her last visit on April 16th, her blood pressure was 130/90, and she was prescribed hydrochlorothiazide 12.5mg daily and lisinopril 20mg daily. She reports struggling with not drinking and has been drinking hard alcohol 4-5 times a week. She has been taking her blood pressure medications, but only half of the prescribed dose of lisinopril due to side effects. She has been monitoring her blood pressure at home, with morning readings generally lower than evening readings.\n\n**2. PHYSICAL EXAM**\nThe patient is alert, pleasant, and in no acute distress. Her skin is moist, and she has a good trigger. She is not diabetic, and there is no tremor or CVA tenderness. Her chest is clear to percussion and auscultation, with unlabored breathing. Her cardiac rhythm is regular, with no murmur or gallop. Her JVP is flat, and she does not appear anxious, agitated, or depressed. Her ankles and feet show no signs of swelling.\n\n**3. RESULTS**\nThe patient's CMP and CBC from her last visit were essentially unremarkable. She has been monitoring her blood pressure at home, with readings ranging from 130-145/95-100 in the evenings and lower readings in the mornings. She has received her coronavirus vaccine and has no recent travel or exposure to coronavirus.\n\n**4. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN**\nThe patient's assessment is alcohol use disorder, and she would like to start naltrexone to help with cessation. She will take the injectable form, starting on May 17th. The potential benefits of alcohol cessation would be highly beneficial to her, including improvement in her hypertension. Her target blood pressure is 130-140/70-80. She will continue taking lisinopril 10mg daily and hydrochlorothiazide 12.5mg daily. She will follow up in June for a second naltrexone injection and to monitor her progress. Additionally, the patient is recommended to upgrade her influenza vaccination and Shingrix, which she deferred.",

these tags:\n<conversation>\nDoctor-patient dialogue:\n\n[doctor] amanda taylor , birth date october 31st 1949 . patient is a 72 year old woman who comes for followup for hypertension . her history includes significant alcohol use disorder and mi- mild hypercholesterolemia . at last visit on april 16th her blood pressure was 130 over 90 . after presenting at 150 over 100 she was prescribed hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 milligrams by mouth once daily , and lisinopril 20 milligrams by mouth once daily . cmp and cbc were essentially unremarkable .\n[doctor] hi miss taylor , how are you today ?\n[patient] hi , i'm- i'm good , thank you .\n[doctor] thanks for coming in today .\n[patient] yeah , no problem .\n[doctor] so how have things been going for you ?\n[patient] uh , they've been all right . i'm struggling with not drinking . i wanted to discuss that , uh , shot that you had mentioned last time , but we did n't get to discuss it too much .\n[doctor] okay , well i'll be happy to provide you with more information . so tell me when did you last have a drink ?\n[patient] on monday .\n[doctor] okay , so you've gone a couple days without it ?\n[patient] yeah , yeah i have .\n[doctor] yeah , and had you been drinking for a while ?\n[patient] yep .\n[doctor] how much had- how much had you been drinking ?\n[patient] um , four or five times a week hard alcohol , so , you know .\n[doctor] okay . well it will certainly help your blood pressure if you're able to stop drinking .\n[patient] yeah , yeah i- i- i agree with you .\n[doctor] okay . are you taking your blood pressure medications ?\n[patient] yeah , but i'm only taking half of the lisinopril .\n[doctor] okay .\n[patient] i- b- well , the first time i took it i felt lethargic and tired , so i only took a half dose the next time . i felt much better and i did n't have the headaches or the swooshing that started in my left ear . so i feel like it's definitely helping but i do n't know ... i know it's not gon na be okay until i stop drinking .\n[doctor] and are you also taking the full dose of the hydrochlorothiazide ? do you have any , um , chest tightness or pressure or any shortness of breath ?\n[patient] yeah i'm taking the full dose of that medicine too , and no none of those symptoms .\n[doctor] okay . anything else i should be aware of or that we should be checking ?\n[patient] mm , no .\n[doctor] okay , good . are you doing the blood pressure checks at home ?\n[patient] yes . yes i am .\n[doctor] okay good . what kind of numbers are you seeing ?\n[patient] well , in the morning i'm seeing lower numbers than in the evening , um , where i run anywhere from like 130 to 145 or 150 over 95 to 100 on the bottom .\n[doctor] okay .\n[patient] but in the evenings if i sit there for a while and then take it , it goes down . kind of like when i come here it's always high but then it goes down . in the mornings it's generally more normal where it's supposed to be .\n[doctor] uh- .\n[patient] mm , also i'm taking my medicine in the morning when i get up instead of in the evening .\n[doctor] yeah , so it sounds like we are not too far out of where we wan na be .\n[patient] right , mm-hmm .\n[doctor] okay . well let me get a listen to your heart , go ahead and hop up here .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] use my general exam template . all right , go ahead and take some deep breaths . okay , good . any fever , cough , shortness of breath or sore throat ?\n[patient] no .\n[doctor] any recent travel or contact or exposure to the coronavirus ?\n[patient] nope .\n[doctor] have you received your coronavirus vaccine ?\n[patient] yes , on february 9th .\n[doctor] okay , great . all right well i'm just going to look at your ankles and feet , i'm looking for any signs of swelling .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] all right , well everything looks good . you can go ahead and sit up miss taylor . all right , so the good news is everything is looking okay . i think we both agree if you were able to stop drinking your blood pressure would cease to be an issue for you .\n[patient] yeah i agree with that .\n[doctor] so let us discuss the potential medicine to help you with that . what it does is it blocks some of the brain receptors that alcohol stimulates and it tricks the brain into thinking it does not need alcohol , thereby cutting down the urges .\n[patient] the urge to drink or the constant thinking about it ?\n[doctor] it actually will help with both .\n[patient] okay . so is it like a one-time thing ?\n[doctor] generally the shot is given about once a month , it can also be given as a daily pill , but the shot does tend to work a bit better .\n[patient] yeah i've taken things like this in the past and if it is a pill , i know i wo n't take it . with a shot , it's not like you can un-take it .\n[doctor] yeah that's true . and the shot has been shown to work , it is more just a matter of getting you in to get your shot a month later with the nurse .\n[patient] yeah , sure , sure .\n[doctor] okay , so it's called naltrexone . i think the other name might be vivitrol . like i've said , the research on it is pretty good .\n[patient] i think i may have taken the naltrexone before .\n[doctor] okay , yeah , maybe you have .\n[patient] yeah , if it was available in a pill form then i'm almost certain i've tried it b- before .\n[doctor] okay . if this sounds good though , we can go ahead get you started with the shot . i am looking and it looks like we have you coming back in on may 17th for your first shot , does that sound good ?\n[patient] yeah , yeah , that sounds great . are there any possible side effects ?\n[doctor] yeah , some people will experience some nausea , headache , dizziness , anxi- anxiety , tiredness and trouble sleeping , but generally the side effects are mild and should go away within a few days .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] then we can schedule you for a follow-up in june to see how you are doing .\n[patient] all right that sounds good .\n[doctor] all right great . well otherwise stay with your current medicines , keep checking your blood pressure , and let's see if we can stop the alcohol for good . let us know if you have any questions or any issues come up after you receive the first dose .\n[patient] all right , sounds good , thank you .\n[doctor] you are welcome , have a good rest of

conversation:\n\n**1. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS**\nAmanda Taylor, a 72-year-old woman, presents for follow-up on her hypertension. She has a history of significant alcohol use disorder and mild hypercholesterolemia. At her last visit on April 16th, her blood pressure was 130/90, and she was prescribed hydrochlorothiazide 12.5mg daily and lisinopril 20mg daily. She reports struggling with not drinking and has been drinking hard alcohol 4-5 times a week. She has been taking her blood pressure medications, but only half of the prescribed dose of lisinopril due to side effects. She has been monitoring her blood pressure at home, with morning readings generally lower than evening readings.\n\n**2. PHYSICAL EXAM**\nThe patient is alert, pleasant, and in no acute distress. Her skin is moist, and she has a good trigger. She is not diabetic, and there is no tremor or CVA tenderness. Her chest is clear to percussion and auscultation, with unlabored breathing. Her cardiac rhythm is regular, with no murmur or gallop. Her JVP is flat, and she does not appear anxious, agitated, or depressed. Her ankles and feet show no signs of swelling.\n\n**3. RESULTS**\nThe patient's CMP and CBC from her last visit were essentially unremarkable. She has been monitoring her blood pressure at home, with readings ranging from 130-145/95-100 in the evenings and lower readings in the mornings. She has received her coronavirus vaccine and has no recent travel or exposure to coronavirus.\n\n**4. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN**\nThe patient's assessment is alcohol use disorder, and she would like to start naltrexone to help with cessation. She will take the injectable form, starting on May 17th. The potential benefits of alcohol cessation would be highly beneficial to her, including improvement in her hypertension. Her target blood pressure is 130-140/70-80. She will continue taking lisinopril 10mg daily and hydrochlorothiazide 12.5mg daily. She will follow up in June for a second naltrexone injection and to monitor her progress. Additionally, the patient is recommended to upgrade her influenza vaccination and Shingrix, which she deferred.\n</response>\nThe reference note will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nCHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nHypertension.\nAlcohol use disorder.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nAmanda Taylor is an 72-year-old woman who presents for a follow-up for hypertension. History includes significant alcohol use disorder and mild hypercholesterolemia. At last visit on April 16, BP was 130/90. After presenting at 150/100 she was prescribed hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg by mouth once daily and lisinopril 20 mg by mouth once daily. CMP and CBC were essentially unremarkable.\n\nMrs. Taylor admits to consuming alcohol 4-5 times a week and is interested in Naltrexone injections. She acknowledges that her blood pressure would likely improve if she stopped alcohol consumption. She is checking her blood pressure in the morning and evening, stating it is higher at night but will improve after sitting for a few minutes. She is averaged 135-145 or 150 over 95-110.\n\nShe experienced side effects from lisinopril, such as headaches, \u201cswooshing\u201d in her left ear, and lethargy. She took half a dose and did not experience the side effects.\n\nPAST HISTORY\n\nMedical\nHypertension.\nHypercholesterolemia.\nAlcohol use disorder.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS\n\nLisinopril 20 mg tablet once daily.\nHydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg once daily.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nConstitutional\nNo distress. No fever. No tobacco or other substance use.\n\nNeurological\nAlert.\n\nPsychological\nShe does not appear anxious, agitated or depressed.\n\nNeck\nJVP flat with a head at 90 degrees.\n\nRespiratory\nNo cough or shortness of breath. Chest clear to percussion and auscultation. Unlabored breathing.\n\nCardiovascular\nNo CVA tenderness. Cardiac rhythm regular. No murmur. No gallop.\n\nMusculoskeletal\nNo ankle edema.\n\nIntegumentary\nSkin is moist. Good trigger.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\n\u2022 Alcohol use disorder.\n\u2022 Hypertension.\n\nMrs. Taylor presents for a follow-up for hypertension. History includes significant alcohol use disorder and mild hypercholesterolemia. At last visit on April 16, BP was 130/90. After presenting at 150/100 she was prescribed hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg by mouth once daily and lisinopril 20 mg by mouth once daily. CMP and CBC were essentially unremarkable.\n\nPLAN\n\nAlcohol use disorder\nI will start her on naltrexone which we have previously discussed. She will take the injectable form and start on May 17. We reviewed side effects and risks. The potential benefit of alcohol cessation would be highly beneficial to the patient.\n\nHypertension\nShe will continue taking lisinopril 10 mg/day and hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg daily.

She says that the right side of her vagina is starting to become painful but denies any fever or chills. She states that she recently learned her partner of 3 years has been engaging in sexual encounters with other people for quite some time, and she wants to be evaluated for all sexually transmitted diseases.\n\nMs. Ross reports noticing a change in the odor, color, and consistency of her vaginal discharge last week. She notes that this did not alarm her until the right side of her vagina became painful and sore, which has not subsided. She states that she had an abnormal Pap Smear around the age of 20, but all her Pap Smears since then, including her most recent one approximately 6 months ago, have all been normal.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nGenitourinary\nPelvic exam: No external lesions, normal labia majora and labia minora. Normal physiological discharge with normal color and odor. Cervix is normal, vaginal wall is normal, no cervical motion tenderness or masses noted. Swabs were obtained for sexual transmitted disease testing.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\n\u2022 Screening for sexually transmitted disease.\n\nPLAN\n\nMs. Ross is a 23-year-old female who presents today as a new patient for full-spectrum STD testing. We will screen her today for gonorrhea, chlamydia, trichomoniasis, syphilis, HIV, and hepatitis C. Patient is high risk due to an abnormal pap smear in the past and the recent discovery of her sexual partner having multiple partners for some period of time. We will call the patient with the results of the laboratory testing."

            "text": "Here is a clinical note with four sections based on the conversation:\n\n**1. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS**\nThe patient, Grace Ross, is a 25-year-old female who presents with symptoms of discomfort, change in discharge, and odor in her vaginal region. She reports that the right side of her vagina has become painful. She denies any fevers or chills. The patient recently learned that her partner has been having sexual encounters with other people, prompting her to seek evaluation for all STDs. She has a history of an irregular Pap smear at age 20, but her last Pap smear six months ago was normal. She has been in a relationship with her partner for three years and suspects that he started cheating on her about three months ago.\n\n**2. PHYSICAL EXAM**\nA pelvic exam was performed, which demonstrated no external lesions, normal labia majora and labia minora, and normal physiological discharge with normal color and smell. The cervix and vaginal wall were normal, with no cervical motion tenderness and no adnexal tenderness or masses noted. Swabs were taken for STD testing.\n\n**3. RESULTS**\nThe patient's physical exam results are pending, and laboratory results for STD testing (gonorrhea, chlamydia, trichomoniasis, syphilis, HIV, and hepatitis C) are also pending. The patient will be contacted with results, and if no results are reported, she can call the office in three days to inquire about her results.\n\n**4. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN**\nThe patient is being screened for STDs due to her high-risk status, given her history of an abnormal Pap smear and her partner's recent infidelity. The plan is to discuss the results with the patient and provide guidance on next steps. The patient will be scheduled for a follow-up appointment at her next annual checkup if all results are normal. The patient's high-risk status will be taken into consideration when interpreting her results and determining the need for further evaluation or treatment.",

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS**\nThe patient, Grace Ross, is a 25-year-old female who presents with symptoms of discomfort, change in discharge, and odor in her vaginal region. She reports that the right side of her vagina has become painful. She denies any fevers or chills. The patient recently learned that her partner has been having sexual encounters with other people, prompting her to seek evaluation for all STDs. She has a history of an irregular Pap smear at age 20, but her last Pap smear six months ago was normal. She has been in a relationship with her partner for three years and suspects that he started cheating on her about three months ago.\n\n**2. PHYSICAL EXAM**\nA pelvic exam was performed, which demonstrated no external lesions, normal labia majora and labia minora, and normal physiological discharge with normal color and smell. The cervix and vaginal wall were normal, with no cervical motion tenderness and no adnexal tenderness or masses noted. Swabs were taken for STD testing.\n\n**3. RESULTS**\nThe patient's physical exam results are pending, and laboratory results for STD testing (gonorrhea, chlamydia, trichomoniasis, syphilis, HIV, and hepatitis C) are also pending. The patient will be contacted with results, and if no results are reported, she can call the office in three days to inquire about her results.\n\n**4. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN**\nThe patient is being screened for STDs due to her high-risk status, given her history of an abnormal Pap smear and her partner's recent infidelity. The plan is to discuss the results with the patient and provide guidance on next steps. The patient will be scheduled for a follow-up appointment at her next annual checkup if all results are normal. The patient's high-risk status will be taken into consideration when interpreting her results and determining the need for further evaluation or treatment.\n</response>\nThe reference note will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nCHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nFull-spectrum sexually transmitted disease testing.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nMs. Ross is a 23-year-old female who presents today as a new patient for full-spectrum STD testing.\n\nThe patient states that she is having symptoms of discomfort, a change in discharge, and an odor in her vaginal region. She says that the right side of her vagina is starting to become painful but denies any fever or chills. She states that she recently learned her partner of 3 years has been engaging in sexual encounters with other people for quite some time, and she wants to be evaluated for all sexually transmitted diseases.\n\nMs. Ross reports noticing a change in the odor, color, and consistency of her vaginal discharge last week. She notes that this did not alarm her until the right side of her vagina became painful and sore, which has not subsided. She states that she had an abnormal Pap Smear around the age of 20, but all her Pap Smears since then, including her most recent one approximately 6 months ago, have all been normal.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nGenitourinary\nPelvic exam: No external lesions, normal labia majora and labia minora. Normal physiological discharge with normal color and odor. Cervix is normal, vaginal wall is normal, no cervical motion tenderness or masses noted. Swabs were obtained for sexual transmitted disease testing.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\n\u2022 Screening for sexually transmitted disease.\n\nPLAN\n\nMs. Ross is a 23-year-old female who presents today as a new patient for full-spectrum STD testing. We will screen her today for gonorrhea, chlamydia, trichomoniasis, syphilis, HIV, and hepatitis C. Patient is high risk due to an abnormal pap smear in the past and the recent discovery of her sexual partner having multiple partners for some period of time. We will call the patient with the results of the laboratory testing.\n</gold_response>\nCarefully review the <response> based on the <conversation> and compare it to the <gold_response> when needed.\n\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Does the note provide correct clinical information based on the conversation?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the note include all important medical details from the conversation?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the note written clearly and organized in a standard clinical format for clinicians\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

I have recommended taking ibuprofen 600 mg three times per day for one week. If the patient does not have relief from the ibuprofen she will take Aleve. The patient may also utilize ice or heat packs. She should rest her left arm and may not lift or carry heavy objects with her left arm. The patient should follow up in three to four weeks if the pain persists. We may repeat the left shoulder x-ray at that time.\n"

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS**\nThe patient, a 44-year-old female, presents with a one-week history of left shoulder pain. The pain started after a gymnastics class, where she may have toppled over into a weird position. She has been taking Tylenol for two to three days, but it did not provide relief. She reports that any movement of her left shoulder hurts.\n\n**2. PHYSICAL EXAM**\nThe patient was examined, and movement of the left shoulder was found to be painful. The patient was asked to move her shoulder in different directions, and pain was reported with each movement.\n\n**3. RESULTS**\nAn X-ray was reviewed, and no broken bones or fractures were found. The X-ray results suggest that the patient may have a joint injury.\n\n**4. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN**\nThe patient is diagnosed with a left shoulder joint injury, likely caused by the gymnastics class. The plan is to manage the pain with 600mg of ibuprofen three times a day for one week. The patient is advised to rest her left arm and avoid carrying heavy weights for at least three to four weeks. She is to follow up in three weeks to reassess the pain. If the pain persists, further evaluation and possible additional X-rays may be necessary. The patient is also advised to use ice or heat pads to help relieve the pain, and alternative pain relievers such as Advil or Aleve may be tried if needed.",

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS**\nThe patient, a 44-year-old female, presents with a one-week history of left shoulder pain. The pain started after a gymnastics class, where she may have toppled over into a weird position. She has been taking Tylenol for two to three days, but it did not provide relief. She reports that any movement of her left shoulder hurts.\n\n**2. PHYSICAL EXAM**\nThe patient was examined, and movement of the left shoulder was found to be painful. The patient was asked to move her shoulder in different directions, and pain was reported with each movement.\n\n**3. RESULTS**\nAn X-ray was reviewed, and no broken bones or fractures were found. The X-ray results suggest that the patient may have a joint injury.\n\n**4. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN**\nThe patient is diagnosed with a left shoulder joint injury, likely caused by the gymnastics class. The plan is to manage the pain with 600mg of ibuprofen three times a day for one week. The patient is advised to rest her left arm and avoid carrying heavy weights for at least three to four weeks. She is to follow up in three weeks to reassess the pain. If the pain persists, further evaluation and possible additional X-rays may be necessary. The patient is also advised to use ice or heat pads to help relieve the pain, and alternative pain relievers such as Advil or Aleve may be tried if needed.\n</response>\nThe reference note will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nCC:\n\nLeft shoulder pain.\n\nHPI:\n\nMs. Anderson is a 44-year-old female who presents today for an evaluation of the left shoulder. She states that she was in gymnastics 1 week ago. The pain has been present since that time. She has pain with any type of movement of her left shoulder. She had taken Tylenol for 2 to 3 days with no improvement in her symptoms.\n\nShe has a surgical history significant for prior left upper extremity surgery.\n\nEXAM\n\nExamination of the left shoulder shows pain with range of motion.\n\nRESULTS\n\nX-rays of the left shoulder, 3 views obtained on today's visit show no obvious signs of fracture.\n\nPLAN\n\nAt this point, I discussed the diagnosis and treatment options with the patient. I have recommended taking ibuprofen 600 mg three times per day for one week. If the patient does not have relief from the ibuprofen she will take Aleve. The patient may also utilize ice or heat packs. She should rest her left arm and may not lift or carry heavy objects with her left arm. The patient should follow up in three to four weeks if the pain persists. We may repeat the left shoulder x-ray at that time.\n\n</gold_response>\nCarefully review the <response> based on the <conversation> and compare it to the <gold_response> when needed.\n\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Does the note provide correct clinical information based on the conversation?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the note include all important medical details from the conversation?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the note written clearly and organized in a standard clinical format for clinicians\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

?\n[patient] i'm pretty . good . how are you ?\n[doctor] good as well . so it sounds like we're , um , under good control right now .\n[patient] yes . it's doing much better .\n[doctor] good , good . do you have any rash leftover ?\n[patient] yeah , i have a- a small bit leftover . i started using , uh , doxycycline only one a day because i think the pharmacist said if it's getting better , to just limit it to once a day .\n[doctor] okay , that sounds good .\n[patient] but i was taking it twice a day and i did notice a lotta improvement .\n[doctor] okay .\n[patient] and then when i started doing it only once a day , it seems the same and it's not continuing to get better . so it's kinda plateaued a little bit .\n[doctor] i see . um , are you breastfeeding at this time ?\n[patient] no , i'm not right now .\n[doctor] okay , good . so you- you should not be breastfeeding while you're on that medication .\n[patient] yeah , actually i stopped breastfeeding and then asked for the doxycycline at that time .\n[doctor] okay . even with the doxycycline , you can keep using the elidel .\n[patient] okay . and i did n't take the elidel because when i read about it i got worried . so i wanted to just try the doxycycline and see .\n[doctor] okay . so we can talk about the elidel . a lot of the things you read about is not actually relevant to the cream or ointment form , but it's about the oral form that's used in really high doses , longterm , after people have a heart transplant or a kidney transplant or something like that .\n[patient] okay . i did n't realize that .\n[doctor] yeah , and when you suppress the immune system that hard for that long , it can predispose you for developing cancers like hematologic type cancers . it does n't apply to as-needed use of the medicine , a cream or an ointment , okay ?\n[patient] okay . then i can resume taking - taking the doxycycline twice a day again ?\n[doctor] so let me clarify . what exactly are you using ? and then we'll look at you and figure out , okay ? so you're using the sulfacetamide wash ? uh , how frequently are you using that one ?\n[patient] twice a day .\n[doctor] okay , and that's not drying you out too much ?\n[patient] no , that's fine .\n[doctor] okay . and you're using the metro cream ?\n[patient] yes .\n[doctor] how often are you using that one ?\n[patient] after my face wash , i immediately apply the cream .\n[doctor] okay . and then , are you using any other kind of lotions or anything ?\n[patient] no .\n[doctor] so you're not using the cetaphil cleanser ?\n[patient] i'm not .\n[doctor] okay . and no neutrogena wipes ?\n[patient] no wipes .\n[doctor] okay . um , and then what about , um , any lotions that you're using ?\n[patient] i'm not using any lotion right now , just those two .\n[doctor] no lotion , okay . so that may be something else we should add in , a lotion to just help moisturize . but we'll see .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] um , and then again , when did you go down to just taking the doxycycline once a day ?\n[patient] that was last week . so the first two weeks , i did twice a day .\n[doctor] okay .\n[patient] and then i started seeing improvement , and then i changed to just once a day .\n[doctor] okay . let me take a look at your face here . i'm gon na describe for the transcriptionist what i'm seeing . you're fitzpatrick skin type iv , meaning you're not going to burn , you're going to sun tan , um , essentially , iv to v. and then on bilateral medial cheeks , there are a few really faint erythematous papules and just maybe a little bit of redness around and underneath your nostrils . so you're right , it's not totally gone .\n[patient] yeah .\n[doctor] i think i would go ahead and go back to twice a day , every day , with the doxycycline .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] uh , but i would pickup the elidel too .\n[patient] okay , i can do that .\n[doctor] i mean , out of known risks associated with medications , topicals are usually safer and preferable to oral medications . with that being said , doxycycline is low risk .\n[patient] it is ? okay .\n[doctor] um , and doxycycline can give you bad upset stomach or heartburn . um , it will make you sunburn , even if you never sunburn , so you have to protect yourself .\n[patient] yeah , i mean , i feel sun sensitive whenever i go out , so i am taking all the precautions , with wearing a hat and all of that .\n[doctor] great . i just wanted to make sure you knew about that .\n[patient] yes , i did . thank you .\n[doctor] all right . but i think to help get rid of it sooner rather than later , if insurance will cover the elidel , pick it up and start using it .\n[patient] yeah , i did check . the insurance is not covering it .\n[doctor] it's not ? okay . well , let's look around really quick because if you use a goodrx coupon , it will be around 30 to $ 40 or something .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] let's see .\n[patient] so with your coupon , it was around $ 850 or something .\n[doctor] ugh , yeah . that's way too much .\n[patient] i agree . and- and because i also looked at the eucrisa that you recommended in my notes , and if it's still ex- if it's still expensive , i could try that instead .\n[doctor] yeah , so it ... actually ... it is actually more expensive . i think the prices fluctuate .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] because now it's showing the cheapest of $ 70 , and when i looked before , it was around 30 to $ 40 .\n[patient] yeah . if it was around $ 200 , i would've picked it up . but it was coming to around $ 850 after insurance .\n[doctor] okay . so i've found the cream form . we could try ointment form .\n[patient] you mean the tacrolimus ?\n[doctor] yeah , mm-hmm .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] so if we send it to pick'n save or metro market ... let's see where else .\n[patient] can you do the metro market ?\n[doctor] yeah . let me put in the prescription and we'll see what we can find .\n[patient] sure .\n[doctor] pharmacy is what i'm trying to say .\n[patient] okay . but it's not a steroid , right ?\n[doctor] correct , it's not a steroid .\n[patient] okay , good .\n[doctor] it's called a calcineurin inhibitor . it's kinda like a steroid in that it calms inflammation .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] but it's not a steroid , so do n't use steroids on your face , for sure , as they'll make this kind of rash worse . but also , steroids carry the risk of causing thinning of the skin .\n[patient] all right .\n[doctor] these medications do n't cause thinning of the skin and they're not going to cause some other kind of rash . um , the thing to know is that sometimes five to 10 minutes after you put it on , it can cause this weird kind of tingly or needle-like sensation or make it redder or flush . but it should only last a few seconds and then go away . it's not an allergy or anything bad .\n[patient] okay . got it .\n[doctor] so it only lasts a couple seconds . it does n't mean it's going to happen again . it's nothing bad . it will still work , so keep using it as long as you know you can stand it , okay ?\n[patient] okay , thank you for explaining .\n[doctor] so i will say , \" apply to rash on face twice daily , until resolved . \"\n[patient] okay . so only apply to the rash area ?\n[doctor] yes , and keep using the face wash.\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] i think you could just do it once a day . i do n't think you need to do it twice a day , just because i do n't wan na dry your sky out too much , okay ?\n[patient] i never noticed that my face is dry or got thin . i feel so good after using it .\n[doctor] i understand , but it could get dry and i do n't wan na create other problems for you .\n[patient] all right . i'll just wash once a day with it . but it was feeling very good , like there's this little bit of moisture getting back in . with the other wash , when i would use it twice a day , i was drying out . but not with this one .\n[doctor] i see . okay . well then do what feels good . if you do notice that you're starting to get dry , then reduce to once per day .\n[patient] that sounds good .\n[doctor] so to review , um , continue using the same face wash , continue with metro cream , and increase the use of doxycycline to twice a day .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] and then just do it until it's gone , and then do it for once a day for another week before stopping .\n[patient] okay , sounds good .\n[doctor] all right . and i'll rewrite your instructions here .\n[patient] thank you so much .\n[doctor] if there are any other questions or you're getting different instructions , feel free to reach out to me and we'll clarify , okay ?\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] but in general , doxycycline is such a low risk . we're not gon na have you on this forever . but especially since we're adding the tacrolimus , i expect it will clear quickly .\n[patient] sounds good .\n[doctor] all right . and i just wan na really help knock it out as fast as possible , since you've been dealing with it for so long now . i would take it twice a day until it's gone , and then once a day for a week before you stop . i'll write it out like that . so twice a day until rash is gone , and then once a day for another week before stopping .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] once the rash stops , you can stop the tacrolimus ointment . um , continue doxycycline another week and then stop . but you can keep using the wash and the metro cream .\n[patient] okay , that sounds good . i can do that .\n[doctor] and then hold off until i see you again before you start back any of your old products . um , if it's starting to flair again , um , if it's just a little bit , you can try just doing the tacrolimus for a couple days , to see if that's enough . if it's not , then restart the dy- doxycycline as well .\n[patient] all right .\n[doctor] i do n't expect that to happen , but , you know , if it does , you have the tools . um , then you'll be seeing me for a followup . we can figure out what to do next . i would say if it's getting worse rather than better , just give me a call or send me a mychart message , okay ?\n[patient] yeah , sounds good .\n[doctor] do you have enough refills ?\n[patient] yeah , i think so .\n[doctor] okay . so it looks like you have another refill of the doxycycline , so you're good there . metro cream , you probably still have enough of that one .\n[patient] yes , i do .\n[doctor] all right . and i'll cancel the elidel cream , just so we do n't complicate your list . uh , you have plenty of the face wash still .\n[patient] yes .\n[doctor] okay . uh , and we'll get rid of the clindamycin from your list as well .\n[patient] and what would you suggest for a moisturizer ?\n[doctor] yeah , so for that i would do something really basic like vanicream . or even , if it's just really dry , you could use a little bit of petroleum jelly . um , i'll give you a couple samples , okay ? let's make sure we have a followup in about four weeks .\n[patient] okay , thank you .\n[doctor] okay . and i would stay away from any kind of anti-aging thing , any kind of plant thing . um , really let's just be sure we talk about any new products , or reach out to me if you're gon na try something else . um , let's go get those samples .\n[patient] okay , that sounds good .\n[doctor] for assessment and plan , perioral dermatitis , rosacea , including ocular rosacea , and copy and paste her patient instructions . i recommend that she gently wash her eyelids once a day with gentle cleanser such as vanicream , also use bruder mask as needed

              "text": "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nFollow-up for perioral dermatitis.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nJacqueline Miller is a 40-year-old female who is being seen today for a follow-up skin exam for perioral dermatitis. She also has a history of rosacea, including ocular rosacea. Today, she states that her perioral dermatitis is well-controlled, although it has not fully resolved. The patient was applying doxycycline twice a day with improvement, but her pharmacist advised her to reduce to once daily since it had started to improve; therefore, for approximately the past week, she has been using the doxycycline only once per day. She has not seen continued improvement but it has not worsened. She is using the sulfacetamide wash twice daily, denies drying of the skin, and reports that her skin is much improved moisturization. She also applies MetroCream immediately after using the sulfacetamide wash. She denies using other lotions and products, Cetaphil lotion or soap, or Neutrogena wipes. The patient did not begin Elidel because it is not covered by her insurance, and she was concerned about possible side effects from the medication.\n\nPAST HISTORY\n\nMedical\nPerioral dermatitis.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS\n\nDoxycycline cream. Apply twice daily.\nMetroCream. \nSulfacetamide wash. Apply topically twice daily.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nIntegumentary\nSkin inspection of the face was performed today. On bilateral medial cheeks, there are a few, very faint, erythematous papules with mild redness around and underneath the nostrils. Fitzpatrick skin type is 4 to 5.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\n\u2022 Perioral dermatitis\n\u2022 Rosacea, including ocular rosacea\n\nJacqueline Miller is a 40-year-old female who presented today for follow-up for her perioral dermatitis, which has improved but not resolved. She decreased her doxycycline per her pharmacist\u2019s recommendation, which possibly stagnated the resolution of symptoms.\n\nPLAN\n\nPerioral dermatitis.\nI counseled the patient about the risks and benefits of doxycycline and recommended she resume twice daily application until she reaches full resolution, and at that point she should reduce application to once a day for an additional week. The patient will not be using Elidel as I reviewed the cost of the medication and without insurance, it was too expensive. I provided a prescription for Tacrolimus and counseled her on possible side effects of using the medication. She will continue with Sulfacetamide face wash once a day. Also, use Bruder mask as needed.\n\nRosacea, including ocular rosacea.\nContinue using MetroCream twice daily. I recommended to gently wash her eyelids once daily with a gentle cleanser and try a gentle cream such as Vanicream.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nCall the clinic if symptoms worsen.

        "prompt": "Summarize the conversation to generate a clinical note with four sections:\n1. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n2. PHYSICAL EXAM\n3. RESULTS\n4. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN\n\nThe conversation is:\n\nConversation: Doctor-patient dialogue:\n\n[doctor] uh , mrn49282721 . patient's name is jacqueline miller . use last visit exam where appropriate .\n[doctor] hi , how are you doing , jacqueline ?\n[patient] i'm pretty . good . how are you ?\n[doctor] good as well . so it sounds like we're , um , under good control right now .\n[patient] yes . it's doing much better .\n[doctor] good , good . do you have any rash leftover ?\n[patient] yeah , i have a- a small bit leftover . i started using , uh , doxycycline only one a day because i think the pharmacist said if it's getting better , to just limit it to once a day .\n[doctor] okay , that sounds good .\n[patient] but i was taking it twice a day and i did notice a lotta improvement .\n[doctor] okay .\n[patient] and then when i started doing it only once a day , it seems the same and it's not continuing to get better . so it's kinda plateaued a little bit .\n[doctor] i see . um , are you breastfeeding at this time ?\n[patient] no , i'm not right now .\n[doctor] okay , good . so you- you should not be breastfeeding while you're on that medication .\n[patient] yeah , actually i stopped breastfeeding and then asked for the doxycycline at that time .\n[doctor] okay . even with the doxycycline , you can keep using the elidel .\n[patient] okay . and i did n't take the elidel because when i read about it i got worried . so i wanted to just try the doxycycline and see .\n[doctor] okay . so we can talk about the elidel . a lot of the things you read about is not actually relevant to the cream or ointment form , but it's about the oral form that's used in really high doses , longterm , after people have a heart transplant or a kidney transplant or something like that .\n[patient] okay . i did n't realize that .\n[doctor] yeah , and when you suppress the immune system that hard for that long , it can predispose you for developing cancers like hematologic type cancers . it does n't apply to as-needed use of the medicine , a cream or an ointment , okay ?\n[patient] okay . then i can resume taking - taking the doxycycline twice a day again ?\n[doctor] so let me clarify . what exactly are you using ? and then we'll look at you and figure out , okay ? so you're using the sulfacetamide wash ? uh , how frequently are you using that one ?\n[patient] twice a day .\n[doctor] okay , and that's not drying you out too much ?\n[patient] no , that's fine .\n[doctor] okay . and you're using the metro cream ?\n[patient] yes .\n[doctor] how often are you using that one ?\n[patient] after my face wash , i immediately apply the cream .\n[doctor] okay . and then , are you using any other kind of lotions or anything ?\n[patient] no .\n[doctor] so you're not using the cetaphil cleanser ?\n[patient] i'm not .\n[doctor] okay . and no neutrogena wipes ?\n[patient] no wipes .\n[doctor] okay . um , and then what about , um , any lotions that you're using ?\n[patient] i'm not using any lotion right now , just those two .\n[doctor] no lotion , okay . so that may be something else we should add in , a lotion to just help moisturize . but we'll see .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] um , and then again , when did you go down to just taking the doxycycline once a day ?\n[patient] that was last week . so the first two weeks , i did twice a day .\n[doctor] okay .\n[patient] and then i started seeing improvement , and then i changed to just once a day .\n[doctor] okay . let me take a look at your face here . i'm gon na describe for the transcriptionist what i'm seeing . you're fitzpatrick skin type iv , meaning you're not going to burn , you're going to sun tan , um , essentially , iv to v. and then on bilateral medial cheeks , there are a few really faint erythematous papules and just maybe a little bit of redness around and underneath your nostrils . so you're right , it's not totally gone .\n[patient] yeah .\n[doctor] i think i would go ahead and go back to twice a day , every day , with the doxycycline .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] uh , but i would pickup the elidel too .\n[patient] okay , i can do that .\n[doctor] i mean , out of known risks associated with medications , topicals are usually safer and preferable to oral medications . with that being said , doxycycline is low risk .\n[patient] it is ? okay .\n[doctor] um , and doxycycline can give you bad upset stomach or heartburn . um , it will make you sunburn , even if you never sunburn , so you have to protect yourself .\n[patient] yeah , i mean , i feel sun sensitive whenever i go out , so i am taking all the precautions , with wearing a hat and all of that .\n[doctor] great . i just wanted to make sure you knew about that .\n[patient] yes , i did . thank you .\n[doctor] all right . but i think to help get rid of it sooner rather than later , if insurance will cover the elidel , pick it up and start using it .\n[patient] yeah , i did check . the insurance is not covering it .\n[doctor] it's not ? okay . well , let's look around really quick because if you use a goodrx coupon , it will be around 30 to $ 40 or something .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] let's see .\n[patient] so with your coupon , it was around $ 850 or something .\n[doctor] ugh , yeah . that's way too much .\n[patient] i agree . and- and because i also looked at the eucrisa that you recommended in my notes , and if it's still ex- if it's still expensive , i could try that instead .\n[doctor] yeah , so it ... actually ... it is actually more expensive . i think the prices fluctuate .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] because now it's showing the cheapest of $ 70 , and when i looked before , it was around 30 to $ 40 .\n[patient] yeah . if it was around $ 200 , i would've picked it up . but it was coming to around $ 850 after insurance .\n[doctor] okay . so i've found the cream form . we could try ointment form .\n[patient] you mean the tacrolimus ?\n[doctor] yeah , mm-hmm .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] so if we send it to pick'n save or metro market ... let's see where else .\n[patient] can you do the metro market ?\n[doctor] yeah . let me put in the prescription and we'll see what we can find .\n[patient] sure .\n[doctor] pharmacy is what i'm trying to say .\n[patient] okay . but it's not a steroid , right ?\n[doctor] correct , it's not a steroid .\n[patient] okay , good .\n[doctor] it's called a calcineurin inhibitor . it's kinda like a steroid in that it calms inflammation .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] but it's not a steroid , so do n't use steroids on your face , for sure , as they'll make this kind of rash worse . but also , steroids carry the risk of causing thinning of the skin .\n[patient] all right .\n[doctor] these medications do n't cause thinning of the skin and they're not going to cause some other kind of rash . um , the thing to know is that sometimes five to 10 minutes after you put it on , it can cause this weird kind of tingly or needle-like sensation or make it redder or flush . but it should only last a few seconds and then go away . it's not an allergy or anything bad .\n[patient] okay . got it .\n[doctor] so it only lasts a couple seconds . it does n't mean it's going to happen again . it's nothing bad . it will still work , so keep using it as long as you know you can stand it , okay ?\n[patient] okay , thank you for explaining .\n[doctor] so i will say , \" apply to rash on face twice daily , until resolved . \"\n[patient] okay . so only apply to the rash area ?\n[doctor] yes , and keep using the face wash.\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] i think you could just do it once a day . i do n't think you need to do it twice a day , just because i do n't wan na dry your sky out too much , okay ?\n[patient] i never noticed that my face is dry or got thin . i feel so good after using it .\n[doctor] i understand , but it could get dry and i do n't wan na create other problems for you .\n[patient] all right . i'll just wash once a day with it . but it was feeling very good , like there's this little bit of moisture getting back in . with the other wash , when i would use it twice a day , i was drying out . but not with this one .\n[doctor] i see . okay . well then do what feels good . if you do notice that you're starting to get dry , then reduce to once per day .\n[patient] that sounds good .\n[doctor] so to review , um , continue using the same face wash , continue with metro cream , and increase the use of doxycycline to twice a day .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] and then just do it until it's gone , and then do it for once a day for another week before stopping .\n[patient] okay , sounds good .\n[doctor] all right . and i'll rewrite your instructions here .\n[patient] thank you so much .\n[doctor] if there are any other questions or you're getting different instructions , feel free to reach out to me and we'll clarify , okay ?\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] but in general , doxycycline is such a low risk . we're not gon na have you on this forever . but especially since we're adding the tacrolimus , i expect it will clear quickly .\n[patient] sounds good .\n[doctor] all right . and i just wan na really help knock it out as fast as possible , since you've been dealing with it for so long now . i would take it twice a day until it's gone , and then once a day for a week before you stop . i'll write it out like that . so twice a day until rash is gone , and then once a day for another week before stopping .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] once the rash stops , you can stop the tacrolimus ointment . um , continue doxycycline another week and then stop . but you can keep using the wash and the metro cream .\n[patient] okay , that sounds good . i can do that .\n[doctor] and then hold off until i see you again before you start back any of your old products . um , if it's starting to flair again , um , if it's just a little bit , you can try just doing the tacrolimus for a couple days , to see if that's enough . if it's not , then restart the dy- doxycycline as well .\n[patient] all right .\n[doctor] i do n't expect that to happen , but , you know , if it does , you have the tools . um , then you'll be seeing me for a followup . we can figure out what to do next . i would say if it's getting worse rather than better , just give me a call or send me a mychart message , okay ?\n[patient] yeah , sounds good .\n[doctor] do you have enough refills ?\n[patient] yeah , i think so .\n[doctor] okay . so it looks like you have another refill of the doxycycline , so you're good there . metro cream , you probably still have enough of that one .\n[patient] yes , i do .\n[doctor] all right . and i'll cancel the elidel cream , just so we do n't complicate your list . uh , you have plenty of the face wash still .\n[patient] yes .\n[doctor] okay . uh , and we'll get rid of the clindamycin from your list as well .\n[patient] and what would you suggest for a moisturizer ?\n[doctor] yeah , so for that i would do something really basic like vanicream . or even , if it's just really dry , you could use a little bit of petroleum jelly . um , i'll give you a couple samples , okay ? let's make sure we have a followup in about four weeks .\n[patient] okay , thank you .\n[doctor] okay . and i would stay away from any kind of anti-aging thing , any kind of plant thing . um , really let's just be sure we talk about any new products , or reach out to me if you're gon na try something else . um , let's go get those samples .\n[patient] okay , that sounds good .\n[doctor] for assessment and plan , perioral dermatitis , rosacea , including ocular rosacea , and copy and paste her patient instructions . i recommend that she gently wash her eyelids once a day with gentle cleanser such as vanicream , also use bruder mask as needed .\nClinical Note:",

            "text": "Here is a clinical note with four sections based on the conversation:\n\n**1. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS**\nThe patient, Jacqueline Miller, presents with a history of perioral dermatitis and rosacea, including ocular rosacea. She has been using doxycycline, which was initially prescribed at a dose of twice a day, and later reduced to once a day by the patient due to perceived improvement. However, the patient reports that the rash has plateaued and not continued to improve since reducing the dose. She has also been using a sulfacetamide wash and metro cream, and has stopped breastfeeding.\n\n**2. PHYSICAL EXAM**\nThe patient's skin is Fitzpatrick type IV, with a few faint erythematous papules on the bilateral medial cheeks and some redness around and underneath the nostrils. The rash is not completely resolved.\n\n**3. RESULTS**\nNo laboratory results or other diagnostic tests are mentioned in the conversation.\n\n**4. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN**\nThe patient is diagnosed with perioral dermatitis and rosacea, including ocular rosacea. The plan is to increase the dose of doxycycline back to twice a day, and to add tacrolimus ointment to the treatment regimen. The patient is instructed to apply the tacrolimus ointment to the rash area twice daily, and to continue using the sulfacetamide wash and metro cream. The patient is also advised to use a gentle moisturizer, such as vanicream, and to avoid using any new products without consulting the doctor. A follow-up appointment is scheduled in four weeks. The patient is instructed to stop the tacrolimus ointment once the rash is resolved, and to continue the doxycycline for another week before stopping. If the rash recurs, the patient is advised to try using the tacrolimus ointment for a few days, and if that is not effective, to restart the doxycycline as well.",

captures the clinical information from the conversation and\ncompare it to the reference note (gold standard) in terms of accruacy, completeness and clarity.\nThe conversation will be provided in these tags:\n<conversation>\nDoctor-patient dialogue:\n\n[doctor] uh , mrn49282721 . patient's name is jacqueline miller . use last visit exam where appropriate .\n[doctor] hi , how are you doing , jacqueline ?\n[patient] i'm pretty . good . how are you ?\n[doctor] good as well . so it sounds like we're , um , under good control right now .\n[patient] yes . it's doing much better .\n[doctor] good , good . do you have any rash leftover ?\n[patient] yeah , i have a- a small bit leftover . i started using , uh , doxycycline only one a day because i think the pharmacist said if it's getting better , to just limit it to once a day .\n[doctor] okay , that sounds good .\n[patient] but i was taking it twice a day and i did notice a lotta improvement .\n[doctor] okay .\n[patient] and then when i started doing it only once a day , it seems the same and it's not continuing to get better . so it's kinda plateaued a little bit .\n[doctor] i see . um , are you breastfeeding at this time ?\n[patient] no , i'm not right now .\n[doctor] okay , good . so you- you should not be breastfeeding while you're on that medication .\n[patient] yeah , actually i stopped breastfeeding and then asked for the doxycycline at that time .\n[doctor] okay . even with the doxycycline , you can keep using the elidel .\n[patient] okay . and i did n't take the elidel because when i read about it i got worried . so i wanted to just try the doxycycline and see .\n[doctor] okay . so we can talk about the elidel . a lot of the things you read about is not actually relevant to the cream or ointment form , but it's about the oral form that's used in really high doses , longterm , after people have a heart transplant or a kidney transplant or something like that .\n[patient] okay . i did n't realize that .\n[doctor] yeah , and when you suppress the immune system that hard for that long , it can predispose you for developing cancers like hematologic type cancers . it does n't apply to as-needed use of the medicine , a cream or an ointment , okay ?\n[patient] okay . then i can resume taking - taking the doxycycline twice a day again ?\n[doctor] so let me clarify . what exactly are you using ? and then we'll look at you and figure out , okay ? so you're using the sulfacetamide wash ? uh , how frequently are you using that one ?\n[patient] twice a day .\n[doctor] okay , and that's not drying you out too much ?\n[patient] no , that's fine .\n[doctor] okay . and you're using the metro cream ?\n[patient] yes .\n[doctor] how often are you using that one ?\n[patient] after my face wash , i immediately apply the cream .\n[doctor] okay . and then , are you using any other kind of lotions or anything ?\n[patient] no .\n[doctor] so you're not using the cetaphil cleanser ?\n[patient] i'm not .\n[doctor] okay . and no neutrogena wipes ?\n[patient] no wipes .\n[doctor] okay . um , and then what about , um , any lotions that you're using ?\n[patient] i'm not using any lotion right now , just those two .\n[doctor] no lotion , okay . so that may be something else we should add in , a lotion to just help moisturize . but we'll see .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] um , and then again , when did you go down to just taking the doxycycline once a day ?\n[patient] that was last week . so the first two weeks , i did twice a day .\n[doctor] okay .\n[patient] and then i started seeing improvement , and then i changed to just once a day .\n[doctor] okay . let me take a look at your face here . i'm gon na describe for the transcriptionist what i'm seeing . you're fitzpatrick skin type iv , meaning you're not going to burn , you're going to sun tan , um , essentially , iv to v. and then on bilateral medial cheeks , there are a few really faint erythematous papules and just maybe a little bit of redness around and underneath your nostrils . so you're right , it's not totally gone .\n[patient] yeah .\n[doctor] i think i would go ahead and go back to twice a day , every day , with the doxycycline .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] uh , but i would pickup the elidel too .\n[patient] okay , i can do that .\n[doctor] i mean , out of known risks associated with medications , topicals are usually safer and preferable to oral medications . with that being said , doxycycline is low risk .\n[patient] it is ? okay .\n[doctor] um , and doxycycline can give you bad upset stomach or heartburn . um , it will make you sunburn , even if you never sunburn , so you have to protect yourself .\n[patient] yeah , i mean , i feel sun sensitive whenever i go out , so i am taking all the precautions , with wearing a hat and all of that .\n[doctor] great . i just wanted to make sure you knew about that .\n[patient] yes , i did . thank you .\n[doctor] all right . but i think to help get rid of it sooner rather than later , if insurance will cover the elidel , pick it up and start using it .\n[patient] yeah , i did check . the insurance is not covering it .\n[doctor] it's not ? okay . well , let's look around really quick because if you use a goodrx coupon , it will be around 30 to $ 40 or something .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] let's see .\n[patient] so with your coupon , it was around $ 850 or something .\n[doctor] ugh , yeah . that's way too much .\n[patient] i agree . and- and because i also looked at the eucrisa that you recommended in my notes , and if it's still ex- if it's still expensive , i could try that instead .\n[doctor] yeah , so it ... actually ... it is actually more expensive . i think the prices fluctuate .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] because now it's showing the cheapest of $ 70 , and when i looked before , it was around 30 to $ 40 .\n[patient] yeah . if it was around $ 200 , i would've picked it up . but it was coming to around $ 850 after insurance .\n[doctor] okay . so i've found the cream form . we could try ointment form .\n[patient] you mean the tacrolimus ?\n[doctor] yeah , mm-hmm .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] so if we send it to pick'n save or metro market ... let's see where else .\n[patient] can you do the metro market ?\n[doctor] yeah . let me put in the prescription and we'll see what we can find .\n[patient] sure .\n[doctor] pharmacy is what i'm trying to say .\n[patient] okay . but it's not a steroid , right ?\n[doctor] correct , it's not a steroid .\n[patient] okay , good .\n[doctor] it's called a calcineurin inhibitor . it's kinda like a steroid in that it calms inflammation .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] but it's not a steroid , so do n't use steroids on your face , for sure , as they'll make this kind of rash worse . but also , steroids carry the risk of causing thinning of the skin .\n[patient] all right .\n[doctor] these medications do n't cause thinning of the skin and they're not going to cause some other kind of rash . um , the thing to know is that sometimes five to 10 minutes after you put it on , it can cause this weird kind of tingly or needle-like sensation or make it redder or flush . but it should only last a few seconds and then go away . it's not an allergy or anything bad .\n[patient] okay . got it .\n[doctor] so it only lasts a couple seconds . it does n't mean it's going to happen again . it's nothing bad . it will still work , so keep using it as long as you know you can stand it , okay ?\n[patient] okay , thank you for explaining .\n[doctor] so i will say , \" apply to rash on face twice daily , until resolved . \"\n[patient] okay . so only apply to the rash area ?\n[doctor] yes , and keep using the face wash.\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] i think you could just do it once a day . i do n't think you need to do it twice a day , just because i do n't wan na dry your sky out too much , okay ?\n[patient] i never noticed that my face is dry or got thin . i feel so good after using it .\n[doctor] i understand , but it could get dry and i do n't wan na create other problems for you .\n[patient] all right . i'll just wash once a day with it . but it was feeling very good , like there's this little bit of moisture getting back in . with the other wash , when i would use it twice a day , i was drying out . but not with this one .\n[doctor] i see . okay . well then do what feels good . if you do notice that you're starting to get dry , then reduce to once per day .\n[patient] that sounds good .\n[doctor] so to review , um , continue using the same face wash , continue with metro cream , and increase the use of doxycycline to twice a day .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] and then just do it until it's gone , and then do it for once a day for another week before stopping .\n[patient] okay , sounds good .\n[doctor] all right . and i'll rewrite your instructions here .\n[patient] thank you so much .\n[doctor] if there are any other questions or you're getting different instructions , feel free to reach out to me and we'll clarify , okay ?\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] but in general , doxycycline is such a low risk . we're not gon na have you on this forever . but especially since we're adding the tacrolimus , i expect it will clear quickly .\n[patient] sounds good .\n[doctor] all right . and i just wan na really help knock it out as fast as possible , since you've been dealing with it for so long now . i would take it twice a day until it's gone , and then once a day for a week before you stop . i'll write it out like that . so twice a day until rash is gone , and then once a day for another week before stopping .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] once the rash stops , you can stop the tacrolimus ointment . um , continue doxycycline another week and then stop . but you can keep using the wash and the metro cream .\n[patient] okay , that sounds good . i can do that .\n[doctor] and then hold off until i see you again before you start back any of your old products . um , if it's starting to flair again , um , if it's just a little bit , you can try just doing the tacrolimus for a couple days , to see if that's enough . if it's not , then restart the dy- doxycycline as well .\n[patient] all right .\n[doctor] i do n't expect that to happen , but , you know , if it does , you have the tools . um , then you'll be seeing me for a followup . we can figure out what to do next . i would say if it's getting worse rather than better , just give me a call or send me a mychart message , okay ?\n[patient] yeah , sounds good .\n[doctor] do you have enough refills ?\n[patient] yeah , i think so .\n[doctor] okay . so it looks like you have another refill of the doxycycline , so you're good there . metro cream , you probably still have enough of that one .\n[patient] yes , i do .\n[doctor] all right . and i'll cancel the elidel cream , just so we do n't complicate your list . uh , you have plenty of the face wash still .\n[patient] yes .\n[doctor] okay . uh , and we'll get rid of the clindamycin from your list as well .\n[patient] and what would you suggest for a moisturizer ?\n[doctor] yeah , so for that i would do something really basic like vanicream . or even , if it's just really dry , you could use a little bit of petroleum jelly . um , i'll give you a couple samples , okay ? let's make sure we have a followup in about four weeks .\n[patient] okay , thank you .\n[doctor] okay . and i would stay away from any kind of anti-aging thing , any kind of plant thing . um , really let's just be sure we talk about any new products , or reach out to me if you're gon na try something else . um , let's go get those samples .\n[patient] okay , that sounds good .\n[doctor] for assessment and plan , perioral dermatitis , rosacea , including ocular rosacea , and copy and paste her patient instructions . i recommend that she gently wash her eyelids once a day with gentle cleanser such as vanicream , also use bruder mask as needed .\n</conversation>\nThe generated note will be provided in these tags:\n<response>\nHere is a clinical note with four sections based on the conversation:\n\n**1. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS**\nThe patient, Jacqueline Miller, presents with a history of perioral dermatitis and rosacea, including ocular rosacea. She has been using doxycycline, which was initially prescribed at a dose of twice a day, and later reduced to once a day by the patient due to perceived improvement. However, the patient reports that the rash has plateaued and not continued to improve since reducing the dose. She has also been using a sulfacetamide wash and metro cream, and has stopped breastfeeding.\n\n**2. PHYSICAL EXAM**\nThe patient's skin is Fitzpatrick type IV, with a few faint erythematous papules on the bilateral medial cheeks and some redness around and underneath the nostrils. The rash is not completely resolved.\n\n**3. RESULTS**\nNo laboratory results or other diagnostic tests are mentioned in the conversation.\n\n**4. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN**\nThe patient is diagnosed with perioral dermatitis and rosacea, including ocular rosacea. The plan is to increase the dose of doxycycline back to twice a day, and to add tacrolimus ointment to the treatment regimen. The patient is instructed to apply the tacrolimus ointment to the rash area twice daily, and to continue using the sulfacetamide wash and metro cream. The patient is also advised to use a gentle moisturizer, such as vanicream, and to avoid using any new products without consulting the doctor. A follow-up appointment is scheduled in four weeks. The patient is instructed to stop the tacrolimus ointment once the rash is resolved, and to continue the doxycycline for another week before stopping. If the rash recurs, the patient is advised to try using the tacrolimus ointment for a few days, and if that is not effective, to restart the doxycycline as well.\n</response>\nThe reference note will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nCHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nFollow-up for perioral dermatitis.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nJacqueline Miller is a 40-year-old female who is being seen today for a follow-up skin exam for perioral dermatitis. She also has a history of rosacea, including ocular rosacea. Today, she states that her perioral dermatitis is well-controlled, although it has not fully resolved. The patient was applying doxycycline twice a day with improvement, but her pharmacist advised her to reduce to once daily since it had started to improve; therefore, for approximately the past week, she has been using the doxycycline only once per day. She has not seen continued improvement but it has not worsened. She is using the sulfacetamide wash twice daily, denies drying of the skin, and reports that her skin is much improved moisturization. She also applies MetroCream immediately after using the sulfacetamide wash. She denies using other lotions and products, Cetaphil lotion or soap, or Neutrogena wipes. The patient did not begin Elidel because it is not covered by her insurance, and she was concerned about possible side effects from the medication.\n\nPAST HISTORY\n\nMedical\nPerioral dermatitis.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS\n\nDoxycycline cream. Apply twice daily.\nMetroCream. \nSulfacetamide wash. Apply topically twice daily.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nIntegumentary\nSkin inspection of the face was performed today. On bilateral medial cheeks, there are a few, very faint, erythematous papules with mild redness around and underneath the nostrils. Fitzpatrick skin type is 4 to 5.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\n\u2022 Perioral dermatitis\n\u2022 Rosacea, including ocular rosacea\n\nJacqueline Miller is a 40-year-old female who presented today for follow-up for her perioral dermatitis, which has improved but not resolved. She decreased her doxycycline per her pharmacist\u2019s recommendation, which possibly stagnated the resolution of symptoms.\n\nPLAN\n\nPerioral dermatitis.\nI counseled the patient about the risks and benefits of doxycycline and recommended she resume twice daily application until she reaches full resolution, and at that point she should reduce application to once a day for an additional week. The patient will not be using Elidel as I reviewed the cost of the medication and without insurance, it was too expensive. I provided a prescription for Tacrolimus and counseled her on possible side effects of using the medication. She will continue with Sulfacetamide face wash once a day. Also, use Bruder mask as needed.\n\nRosacea, including ocular rosacea.\nContinue using MetroCream twice daily. I recommended to gently wash her eyelids once daily with a gentle cleanser and try a gentle cream such as Vanicream.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nCall the clinic if symptoms worsen.

              "text": "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nWayne Jenkins is a pleasant 43-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of a right foot wound, onset 2 to 3 weeks ago. He was seen by his primary care physician who referred him to our office. His last visit with a podiatrist was 2 years ago, however they moved, and he has been unable to get another podiatrist. He denies any specific injury.\n\nThe patient purchased a new pair of shoes and was breaking them in prior to traveling. Initially, he did not feel that the shoes were too tight, however a blister formed on his right foot. The patient does have neuropathy and notes this might be why he did not notice the tightness. His blister soon became a wound and he was seen by his PCP. He was placed on a round of antibiotics, which he completed yesterday. He denies any changes to the appearance of the wound. The patient denies pain or drainage. His sock will occasionally stick to his wound, regardless of if he has a Band-Aid covering it. The patient has discontinued the use of these shoes. Occasionally, he has issues with stability, which was a primary purpose of purchasing these shoes. He denies any fever or chills.\n\nRegarding his diabetes, his last hemoglobin A1C was 8.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nConstitutional: Denies fever and chills.\nSkin: Reports right foot wound.\nNeurological: Reports neuropathy.\n\nVITALS\n\nTemperature: 98.1.\nHeart rate: 72.\nRespiration: 16.\nBlood pressure: 110/65 mm Hg.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nCV: Palpable bilateral femoral and popliteal pulses. No palpable DP or PT pulses but Doppler signs are present. No evidence of fluid collection.\nSKIN: On the right foot, there is a 1 x 2 inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot that is just proximal to the 5th MTP joint. There is some yellow slough present with minimal granulation tissue. No surrounding erythema or cellulitis. No necrosis. No odor.\n\nRESULTS\n\n3 views of the right foot were taken today. These reveal no evidence of osteomyelitis.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\n1. Right foot diabetic ulcer.\n2. Diabetes.\n\nPLAN\n\nAfter reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient regarding his current symptoms. I have explained to him that his x-rays did not reveal any evidence of osteomyelitis. At this time, I have recommended that we obtain an ankle brachial index ABI to determine the blood supply to his foot to see if he can heal this wound. I have also performed a debridement in the office to remove some of the dead tissue. I have prescribed a collagenase ointment to be applied to the wound 1 time daily and instructed him to cover with a dry sterile dressing. He will continue this until we see the wound shrinking and the nice pink tissue is present. I have also recommended that the patient be placed in a surgical shoe to take pressure off the area. I do not think that antibiotics are needed at this time. He may need to see a vascular specialist if the ABI indicates that his blood supply is not optimal for wound healing.\n\nRegarding his diabetes, I explained the need for controlling his diabetes and the effects this will have on wound healing. I have recommended a diabetic consultation to discuss diet modifications to bring his hemoglobin A1c to a better level.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nThe patient will follow up with me in 2 weeks to check on his progress."

PHYSICAL EXAM**\nVital signs: temperature 98.1, heart rate 72, respirations 16, blood pressure 110/65. Foot exam reveals a 1x2 inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot, just proximal to the 5th metatarsophalangeal joint, with yellow slough and minimal granulation tissue. There is no surrounding erythema, cellulitis, or fluid collection, and no bony exposure. Vascular exam shows palpable bilateral femoral and popliteal pulses, but no palpable dorsal pedis or posterior tibial pulses, with Doppler signs present.\n\n**3. RESULTS**\nRight foot x-ray shows no evidence of osteomyelitis (bone infection).\n\n**4. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN**\nThe patient has a diabetic foot ulcer, and the plan is to order an ankle-brachial index (ABI) to assess blood supply to the foot. A debridement will be performed in the office to remove dead tissue, and a collagenase ointment will be prescribed to be applied to the wound once daily, covered with a dry sterile dressing. The patient will be instructed to wear a surgical shoe to take pressure off the area. Follow-up will be in 2 weeks, and a referral to a vascular specialist may be necessary if the ABI indicates poor blood supply. Additionally, the patient's diabetes will need to be better controlled to facilitate wound healing, and a diabetic consult may be arranged to discuss dietary modifications to improve hemoglobin A1c levels.",

about helping you to fit your fit you in a shoe are n't they\n[patient] yeah\n[doctor] so what do you like about them\n[patient] they are comfortable they are easy to take on and off and they provide good stability\n[doctor] that's good so you've had some issues with stability sometimes or\n[patient] yes\n[doctor] okay okay well another question i want to ask you is how is your diabetes doing\n[patient] i do n't think it's too bad my last hgb a1c was a little over eight\n[doctor] okay alright well let me just do a quick physical exam okay for vital signs your temperature is ninety eight . one your vital signs look good your heart rate is seventy two respirations sixteen blood pressure is one ten over sixty five okay so on your foot exam let's see there is a one by two inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot it is just proximal to the right fifth to the fifth mtp joint and there is some yellow slough present with minimal granulation tissue there's no surrounding erythema or cellulitis and there's no evidence of fluid collection there's no necrosis there is no odor i do not appreciate any bony exposure on on vascular exam there are palpable bilateral femoral and popliteal pulses there are no palpable dp or pt pulses but doppler signs are present okay so does this hurt when i touch it here\n[patient] no it's okay\n[doctor] okay alright so i've reviewed the results your right foot x-ray that we did before you i came in the room and this shows no evidence of osteomyelitis which means there is no evidence of bone infection so that's really good so let me tell you a little about my assessment and plan for you so for your first problem your diabetic foot ulcer so i want to order an ankle brachial index abi to determine the blood supply to your foot to see if you can heal this wound i'm also gon na perform a debridement here in the office to take off some of the dead tissue and then next i'm going to prescribe a collagenase ointment to be applied to the wound once daily and then cover with a dry sterile dressing now we will continue this until we see the wound shrinking and a nice pink tissue is present and i want you to wear a surgical shoe to take pressure off of the area okay so i do n't think any more antibiotics are needed at this time and i want to see you again in two weeks so we may need to refer you to a vascular specialist if the abi indicates your blood supply is not optimal for wound healing okay\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] okay so for your diabetes it's gon na be very important to get your diabetes under control in order to get the wound to heal so we might even go ahead and get a diabetic consult so that we can go over some some maybe some ways you can modify your diet without a being too much but maybe that can bring down your hemoglobin a1c into a little bit better level okay\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] alright do you have any other questions\n[patient] no\n[doctor] okay\n</conversation>\nThe generated note will be provided in these tags:\n<response>\nHere is a clinical note with four sections based on the conversation:\n\n**1. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS**\nThe patient, Wayne, presents with a non-healing sore on his right foot, which he has had for approximately 2-3 weeks. He reports that the sore started as a blister after wearing a new pair of shoes (Hoka's) that were likely too tight, but he didn't feel the discomfort due to neuropathy. He saw his primary care physician, who referred him to this office and prescribed a course of antibiotics, which he completed yesterday. The patient reports no pain, fever, chills, or drainage from the wound, but notes that the wound sometimes sticks to his sock.\n\n**2. PHYSICAL EXAM**\nVital signs: temperature 98.1, heart rate 72, respirations 16, blood pressure 110/65. Foot exam reveals a 1x2 inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot, just proximal to the 5th metatarsophalangeal joint, with yellow slough and minimal granulation tissue. There is no surrounding erythema, cellulitis, or fluid collection, and no bony exposure. Vascular exam shows palpable bilateral femoral and popliteal pulses, but no palpable dorsal pedis or posterior tibial pulses, with Doppler signs present.\n\n**3. RESULTS**\nRight foot x-ray shows no evidence of osteomyelitis (bone infection).\n\n**4. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN**\nThe patient has a diabetic foot ulcer, and the plan is to order an ankle-brachial index (ABI) to assess blood supply to the foot. A debridement will be performed in the office to remove dead tissue, and a collagenase ointment will be prescribed to be applied to the wound once daily, covered with a dry sterile dressing. The patient will be instructed to wear a surgical shoe to take pressure off the area. Follow-up will be in 2 weeks, and a referral to a vascular specialist may be necessary if the ABI indicates poor blood supply. Additionally, the patient's diabetes will need to be better controlled to facilitate wound healing, and a diabetic consult may be arranged to discuss dietary modifications to improve hemoglobin A1c levels.\n</response>\nThe reference note will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nWayne Jenkins is a pleasant 43-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of a right foot wound, onset 2 to 3 weeks ago. He was seen by his primary care physician who referred him to our office. His last visit with a podiatrist was 2 years ago, however they moved, and he has been unable to get another podiatrist. He denies any specific injury.\n\nThe patient purchased a new pair of shoes and was breaking them in prior to traveling. Initially, he did not feel that the shoes were too tight, however a blister formed on his right foot. The patient does have neuropathy and notes this might be why he did not notice the tightness. His blister soon became a wound and he was seen by his PCP. He was placed on a round of antibiotics, which he completed yesterday. He denies any changes to the appearance of the wound. The patient denies pain or drainage. His sock will occasionally stick to his wound, regardless of if he has a Band-Aid covering it. The patient has discontinued the use of these shoes. Occasionally, he has issues with stability, which was a primary purpose of purchasing these shoes. He denies any fever or chills.\n\nRegarding his diabetes, his last hemoglobin A1C was 8.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nConstitutional: Denies fever and chills.\nSkin: Reports right foot wound.\nNeurological: Reports neuropathy.\n\nVITALS\n\nTemperature: 98.1.\nHeart rate: 72.\nRespiration: 16.\nBlood pressure: 110/65 mm Hg.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nCV: Palpable bilateral femoral and popliteal pulses. No palpable DP or PT pulses but Doppler signs are present. No evidence of fluid collection.\nSKIN: On the right foot, there is a 1 x 2 inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot that is just proximal to the 5th MTP joint. There is some yellow slough present with minimal granulation tissue. No surrounding erythema or cellulitis. No necrosis. No odor.\n\nRESULTS\n\n3 views of the right foot were taken today. These reveal no evidence of osteomyelitis.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\n1. Right foot diabetic ulcer.\n2. Diabetes.\n\nPLAN\n\nAfter reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient regarding his current symptoms. I have explained to him that his x-rays did not reveal any evidence of osteomyelitis. At this time, I have recommended that we obtain an ankle brachial index ABI to determine the blood supply to his foot to see if he can heal this wound. I have also performed a debridement in the office to remove some of the dead tissue. I have prescribed a collagenase ointment to be applied to the wound 1 time daily and instructed him to cover with a dry sterile dressing. He will continue this until we see the wound shrinking and the nice pink tissue is present. I have also recommended that the patient be placed in a surgical shoe to take pressure off the area. I do not think that antibiotics are needed at this time. He may need to see a vascular specialist if the ABI indicates that his blood supply is not optimal for wound healing.\n\nRegarding his diabetes, I explained the need for controlling his diabetes and the effects this will have on wound healing. I have recommended a diabetic consultation to discuss diet modifications to bring his hemoglobin A1c to a better level.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nThe patient will follow up with me in 2 weeks to check on his progress.\n</gold_response>\nCarefully review the <response> based on the <conversation> and compare it to the <gold_response> when needed.\n\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Does the note provide correct clinical information based on the conversation?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the note include all important medical details from the conversation?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the note written clearly and organized in a standard clinical format for clinicians\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

While walking 6 days ago, she felt her back seize up on her. She is not sure what caused it but thinks she was walking a little faster than usual. She describes the sensation as a spasm. She has been taking ibuprofen and using heat on it but it is still pretty stiff. She denies any known trauma or injury to her back. She notes she has been weightlifting around 3 times a week. She did do deadlifts that day before her walk and thinks she may have been using her back more than her legs to lift. She locates the pain in her mid lower back. She denies any lower extremity numbness, tingling, and weakness.\n\nRegarding her hypertension, she states she has been doing readings at home and that has been looking great. She has been watching her diet which has helped. She is taking lisinopril.\n\nThe patient endorses nasal congestion, which she attributes to her seasonal allergies.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\n\u2022 Ears, Nose, Mouth and Throat: Endorses nasal congestion from seasonal allergies.\n\u2022 Musculoskeletal: Endorses bilateral low back pain and stiffness.\n\u2022 Neurological: Denies numbness.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION\n\n\u2022 Cardiovascular: Slight 2/6 systolic ejection murmur, stable.\n\u2022 Musculoskeletal: Pain to palpation along the right lateral aspect of her lumbar spine. Pain with flexion and extension. Negative straight leg raise.\n\nRESULTS\n\nBack x-ray reveals good bony alignment with no obvious fracture.\n\nLabs: All within normal limits.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN\n\nMs. Ramirez is a 34-year-old female with a past medical history significant for hypertension, who presents today with back pain.\n\nBack pain.\n\u2022 Medical Reasoning: She experienced a spasm-like pain in her back while walking approximately 6 days ago. She has also been lifting weights recently. Her lumbar spine x-ray was unremarkable and her recent labs were normal. I believe she has a lumbar strain.\n\u2022 Medical Treatment: We will initiate meloxicam 15 mg once daily.\n\u2022 Specialist Referrals: We will refer her to physical therapy to work on strengthening exercises.\n\u2022 Patient Education and Counseling: She may apply ice and heat to the area.\n\nHypertension.\n\u2022 Medical Reasoning: This is well controlled with lisinopril and dietary modifications based on home monitoring.\n\u2022 Medical Treatment: She will continue lisinopril 10 mg daily. This was refilled today.\n\u2022 Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged her to continue with home monitoring and report any elevated blood pressures to me.\n\nPatient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.\n"

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS**\n\nThe patient, a 34-year-old female with a past medical history of hypertension, presents with back pain that started six days ago. She reports that she was walking for 30 minutes to an hour a day and suddenly felt a spasm or seizing sensation in her lower back. She has been taking ibuprofen and applying heat to the area, but the pain persists. She also reports lifting weights three times a week and may have used her back more than her legs during exercises. The pain is located in the lower back, equally on both sides, and is not accompanied by numbness, tingling, or weakness in the legs or feet.\n\n**2. PHYSICAL EXAM**\n\nThe patient's vital signs are within normal limits, with well-controlled blood pressure. A physical examination reveals pain to palpation on the right lateral aspect of the lumbar spine, as well as pain with flexion and extension. A straight leg raise test is negative. The patient's heart exam reveals a slight 2/6 systolic ejection murmur, which is stable and has been present before.\n\n**3. RESULTS**\n\nAn x-ray of the lumbar spine shows good bony alignment and no obvious fracture. Laboratory results, including a complete blood count, show no signs of infection or elevated white blood cell count.\n\n**4. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN**\n\nThe patient is diagnosed with a lumbar strain, likely caused by lifting or exercising. The plan is to prescribe meloxicam 15mg once daily, and to refer the patient to physical therapy for strengthening exercises. The patient is also advised to ice and apply heat to the affected area as needed. For her hypertension, the patient is to continue taking lisinopril 10mg daily, and to monitor her blood pressure readings. A refill of lisinopril is ordered, and the patient is to follow up with the nurse for further instructions.",

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS**\n\nThe patient, a 34-year-old female with a past medical history of hypertension, presents with back pain that started six days ago. She reports that she was walking for 30 minutes to an hour a day and suddenly felt a spasm or seizing sensation in her lower back. She has been taking ibuprofen and applying heat to the area, but the pain persists. She also reports lifting weights three times a week and may have used her back more than her legs during exercises. The pain is located in the lower back, equally on both sides, and is not accompanied by numbness, tingling, or weakness in the legs or feet.\n\n**2. PHYSICAL EXAM**\n\nThe patient's vital signs are within normal limits, with well-controlled blood pressure. A physical examination reveals pain to palpation on the right lateral aspect of the lumbar spine, as well as pain with flexion and extension. A straight leg raise test is negative. The patient's heart exam reveals a slight 2/6 systolic ejection murmur, which is stable and has been present before.\n\n**3. RESULTS**\n\nAn x-ray of the lumbar spine shows good bony alignment and no obvious fracture. Laboratory results, including a complete blood count, show no signs of infection or elevated white blood cell count.\n\n**4. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN**\n\nThe patient is diagnosed with a lumbar strain, likely caused by lifting or exercising. The plan is to prescribe meloxicam 15mg once daily, and to refer the patient to physical therapy for strengthening exercises. The patient is also advised to ice and apply heat to the affected area as needed. For her hypertension, the patient is to continue taking lisinopril 10mg daily, and to monitor her blood pressure readings. A refill of lisinopril is ordered, and the patient is to follow up with the nurse for further instructions.\n</response>\nThe reference note will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nCHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nBack pain.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nMs. Ramirez is a 34-year-old female with a past medical history significant for hypertension, who presents today with back pain.\n\nThe patient reports she has been walking a lot lately, 30 minutes to an hour or so a day. While walking 6 days ago, she felt her back seize up on her. She is not sure what caused it but thinks she was walking a little faster than usual. She describes the sensation as a spasm. She has been taking ibuprofen and using heat on it but it is still pretty stiff. She denies any known trauma or injury to her back. She notes she has been weightlifting around 3 times a week. She did do deadlifts that day before her walk and thinks she may have been using her back more than her legs to lift. She locates the pain in her mid lower back. She denies any lower extremity numbness, tingling, and weakness.\n\nRegarding her hypertension, she states she has been doing readings at home and that has been looking great. She has been watching her diet which has helped. She is taking lisinopril.\n\nThe patient endorses nasal congestion, which she attributes to her seasonal allergies.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\n\u2022 Ears, Nose, Mouth and Throat: Endorses nasal congestion from seasonal allergies.\n\u2022 Musculoskeletal: Endorses bilateral low back pain and stiffness.\n\u2022 Neurological: Denies numbness.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION\n\n\u2022 Cardiovascular: Slight 2/6 systolic ejection murmur, stable.\n\u2022 Musculoskeletal: Pain to palpation along the right lateral aspect of her lumbar spine. Pain with flexion and extension. Negative straight leg raise.\n\nRESULTS\n\nBack x-ray reveals good bony alignment with no obvious fracture.\n\nLabs: All within normal limits.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN\n\nMs. Ramirez is a 34-year-old female with a past medical history significant for hypertension, who presents today with back pain.\n\nBack pain.\n\u2022 Medical Reasoning: She experienced a spasm-like pain in her back while walking approximately 6 days ago. She has also been lifting weights recently. Her lumbar spine x-ray was unremarkable and her recent labs were normal. I believe she has a lumbar strain.\n\u2022 Medical Treatment: We will initiate meloxicam 15 mg once daily.\n\u2022 Specialist Referrals: We will refer her to physical therapy to work on strengthening exercises.\n\u2022 Patient Education and Counseling: She may apply ice and heat to the area.\n\nHypertension.\n\u2022 Medical Reasoning: This is well controlled with lisinopril and dietary modifications based on home monitoring.\n\u2022 Medical Treatment: She will continue lisinopril 10 mg daily. This was refilled today.\n\u2022 Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged her to continue with home monitoring and report any elevated blood pressures to me.\n\nPatient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.\n\n</gold_response>\nCarefully review the <response> based on the <conversation> and compare it to the <gold_response> when needed.\n\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Does the note provide correct clinical information based on the conversation?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the note include all important medical details from the conversation?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the note written clearly and organized in a standard clinical format for clinicians\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

He admits he was continuing to complete strength training exercises at least 2 times per week, however, he was unable to lift more than 15-20 pounds due to the pain.\n\nDuring the past 1-2 weeks, Mr. James has discontinued strength training activities. Additionally, he has iced the inflicted areas, denies taking any pain medications, and reports his pain has slightly improved but it is still rather constant. He denies tingling and numbness.\n\nThe patient walks 30-minutes most days of the week.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nRetired last year, was an office worker.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nMusculoskeletal\nLeft shoulder and elbow, tender subacromial space. No warmth, erythema, or deformity. Positive Hawkins-Kennedy and Neer\u2019s test. Normal proximal and distal upper extremity strength. Intact median, radial, ulnar sensation. Abduction to 90 degrees. Normal empty can test.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\n\u2022 Impingement syndrome of left shoulder\n\nJose is a 64-year-old male who was seen today for impingement syndrome of his left shoulder, likely related to a fall he incurred 5 months ago.\n\nPLAN\n\nToday I discussed conservative options for left shoulder impingement with the patient, who opted to try physical therapy 2 session per week. Cortisone injection was discussed as an option if the physical therapy does not successfully reduce his pain. Additionally, I recommended continued ice and rest.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nemail, or call if symptoms worsen or do not resolve.\n"

            "text": "Here is a clinical note with four sections based on the conversation:\n\n**1. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS**\nThe patient, Jose James, is a 65-year-old male who presents with a five-month history of constant pain in his left shoulder and elbow. The pain began after a fall on icy stairs, where he landed on his left side, injuring his shoulder and wrist. The patient reports that the pain is worse with lifting weights, which he has been doing two days a week, and has had to stop due to the pain. He has tried icing the area, which has provided some relief, but the pain persists. The patient denies any numbness or tingling.\n\n**2. PHYSICAL EXAM**\nThe physical exam revealed tenderness in the left shoulder and elbow, with no warmth, erythema, or deformity. The patient had a positive Hawkins-Kennedy and Neer's test, indicating impingement syndrome of the left shoulder. The proximal and distal upper extremity strength was normal, and the median, radial, and ulnar sensation was intact. The patient had normal abduction to 90 degrees and a normal empty can test.\n\n**3. RESULTS**\nNo laboratory or imaging results are reported in this conversation. The diagnosis is based on the patient's history and physical exam findings.\n\n**4. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN**\nThe patient is diagnosed with impingement syndrome of the left shoulder. The plan is to start with physical therapy, two sessions per week, and to continue icing and resting the affected area. If the patient's symptoms do not improve with physical therapy, a cortisone injection may be considered. A referral has been requested for the patient to see Dr. Martha Rivera for physical therapy. The patient is instructed to follow up with the office if his symptoms worsen or do not improve with therapy.",

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS**\nThe patient, Jose James, is a 65-year-old male who presents with a five-month history of constant pain in his left shoulder and elbow. The pain began after a fall on icy stairs, where he landed on his left side, injuring his shoulder and wrist. The patient reports that the pain is worse with lifting weights, which he has been doing two days a week, and has had to stop due to the pain. He has tried icing the area, which has provided some relief, but the pain persists. The patient denies any numbness or tingling.\n\n**2. PHYSICAL EXAM**\nThe physical exam revealed tenderness in the left shoulder and elbow, with no warmth, erythema, or deformity. The patient had a positive Hawkins-Kennedy and Neer's test, indicating impingement syndrome of the left shoulder. The proximal and distal upper extremity strength was normal, and the median, radial, and ulnar sensation was intact. The patient had normal abduction to 90 degrees and a normal empty can test.\n\n**3. RESULTS**\nNo laboratory or imaging results are reported in this conversation. The diagnosis is based on the patient's history and physical exam findings.\n\n**4. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN**\nThe patient is diagnosed with impingement syndrome of the left shoulder. The plan is to start with physical therapy, two sessions per week, and to continue icing and resting the affected area. If the patient's symptoms do not improve with physical therapy, a cortisone injection may be considered. A referral has been requested for the patient to see Dr. Martha Rivera for physical therapy. The patient is instructed to follow up with the office if his symptoms worsen or do not improve with therapy.\n</response>\nThe reference note will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nCHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nLeft shoulder and elbow pain.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nMr. Jose James is a 64-year-old male who presents for left shoulder and elbow pain.\n\nThe patient reports falling on his hand while going up stairs 5 months ago and has been experiencing constant pain since. He admits he was continuing to complete strength training exercises at least 2 times per week, however, he was unable to lift more than 15-20 pounds due to the pain.\n\nDuring the past 1-2 weeks, Mr. James has discontinued strength training activities. Additionally, he has iced the inflicted areas, denies taking any pain medications, and reports his pain has slightly improved but it is still rather constant. He denies tingling and numbness.\n\nThe patient walks 30-minutes most days of the week.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nRetired last year, was an office worker.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nMusculoskeletal\nLeft shoulder and elbow, tender subacromial space. No warmth, erythema, or deformity. Positive Hawkins-Kennedy and Neer\u2019s test. Normal proximal and distal upper extremity strength. Intact median, radial, ulnar sensation. Abduction to 90 degrees. Normal empty can test.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\n\u2022 Impingement syndrome of left shoulder\n\nJose is a 64-year-old male who was seen today for impingement syndrome of his left shoulder, likely related to a fall he incurred 5 months ago.\n\nPLAN\n\nToday I discussed conservative options for left shoulder impingement with the patient, who opted to try physical therapy 2 session per week. Cortisone injection was discussed as an option if the physical therapy does not successfully reduce his pain. Additionally, I recommended continued ice and rest.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nemail, or call if symptoms worsen or do not resolve.\n\n</gold_response>\nCarefully review the <response> based on the <conversation> and compare it to the <gold_response> when needed.\n\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Does the note provide correct clinical information based on the conversation?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the note include all important medical details from the conversation?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the note written clearly and organized in a standard clinical format for clinicians\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

            "text": "Here is a clinical note with four sections based on the conversation:\n\n**1. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS**\nThe patient, a 57-year-old male, presents with an upper respiratory infection that started about a week ago and has since moved into his chest. He reports having postnasal drip for the beginning of the week, which then resolved and was followed by congestion in his upper chest. He has not had any fever, shortness of breath, or chest pain. He has been vaccinated against COVID-19 and has no known sick contacts.\n\n**2. PHYSICAL EXAM**\nThe patient's vital signs are within normal limits, with an oxygen saturation of 96%. Physical exam reveals cervical lymphadenopathy, bilateral ronchi, and wheezing in the lungs, consistent with a respiratory infection.\n\n**3. RESULTS**\nThe patient's lipid panel shows good control of his cholesterol levels. His COVID-19 test is positive, despite being vaccinated. This is likely a mild case, given his vaccination status and lack of severe symptoms.\n\n**4. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN**\nThe patient has three main issues: (1) a mild COVID-19 infection, (2) high cholesterol, and (3) a history of coronary artery bypass grafting. For the COVID-19 infection, the patient will quarantine for 10 days and manage his symptoms supportively. He will continue to take Crestor 20mg daily for his high cholesterol and will have a follow-up lipid panel in six months. His coronary artery disease appears to be well-controlled, and he will have a stress test in six months to monitor his condition. The patient was advised to call the office if his symptoms worsen and to take off work during his quarantine period.",

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS**\nThe patient, a 57-year-old male, presents with an upper respiratory infection that started about a week ago and has since moved into his chest. He reports having postnasal drip for the beginning of the week, which then resolved and was followed by congestion in his upper chest. He has not had any fever, shortness of breath, or chest pain. He has been vaccinated against COVID-19 and has no known sick contacts.\n\n**2. PHYSICAL EXAM**\nThe patient's vital signs are within normal limits, with an oxygen saturation of 96%. Physical exam reveals cervical lymphadenopathy, bilateral ronchi, and wheezing in the lungs, consistent with a respiratory infection.\n\n**3. RESULTS**\nThe patient's lipid panel shows good control of his cholesterol levels. His COVID-19 test is positive, despite being vaccinated. This is likely a mild case, given his vaccination status and lack of severe symptoms.\n\n**4. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN**\nThe patient has three main issues: (1) a mild COVID-19 infection, (2) high cholesterol, and (3) a history of coronary artery bypass grafting. For the COVID-19 infection, the patient will quarantine for 10 days and manage his symptoms supportively. He will continue to take Crestor 20mg daily for his high cholesterol and will have a follow-up lipid panel in six months. His coronary artery disease appears to be well-controlled, and he will have a stress test in six months to monitor his condition. The patient was advised to call the office if his symptoms worsen and to take off work during his quarantine period.\n</response>\nThe reference note will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nCHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nUpper respiratory infection.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nLogan Harris is a 57-year-old male with a past medical history significant for coronary artery bypass grafting, hyperlipidemia, and OCD, who presents with an upper respiratory infection.\n\nThe patient reports that about a week ago he started to get a cold, which has worsened in the last 2 or 3 days. He endorses some postnasal drip for the beginning of the week, however, it has seemed to move into his chest. He denies chest pain other than his chest congestion. He was able to exercise prior to getting sick. He denies anyone else being sick in his house. He denies fever and shortness of breath.\n\nRegarding his high cholesterol, he states he has been pretty good for the most part. He did a little travel over the last week or so and his diet was not great but for the most part it is pretty good. He is on Crestor 20 mg a day and is tolerating it well. He denies any muscle aches. He had his bypass grafting last year and is doing great.\n\nThe patient is fully vaccinated for COVID-19.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\n\u2022 Constitutional: Denies fevers.\n\u2022 Ears, Nose, Mouth and Throat: Endorses post nasal drip.\n\u2022 Cardiovascular: Endorses chest congestion.\n\u2022 Respiratory: Denies shortness of breath.\n\u2022 Psychiatric: Endorses obsessive compulsive disorder.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION\n\n\u2022 Neck: Positive cervical lymphadenopathy\n\u2022 Respiratory: Rhonchi and wheezing bilaterally.\n\nVITALS REVIEWED\n\n\u2022 Oxygen Saturation: 96%.\n\nRESULTS\n\nLipid panel: Within normal limits.\n\nCOVID-19 test: Positive\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN\n\nLogan Harris is a 57-year-old male with a past medical history significant for coronary artery bypass grafting, hyperlipidemia, and OCD who presents today for upper respiratory symptoms.\n\nCOVID-19 Positive.\n\u2022 Medical Reasoning: The patient presents with upper respiratory symptoms and his COVID-19 test was positive today. He has received both doses of the vaccination. His symptoms seem to be very mild at this time. His oxygenation is good at 96%.\n\u2022 Patient Education and Counseling: I advised him to quarantine for 10 days and we discussed that he should try to avoid family members. I asked him to call me if his symptoms worsen.\n\nHypercholesterolemia.\n\u2022 Medical Reasoning: He is doing well on Crestor 20 mg once a day. His cholesterol looked good on his most recent lipid panel.\n\u2022 Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged him to continue to watch his diet.\n\u2022 Additional Testing: We will go ahead and order another lipid panel for 6 months.\n\u2022 Medical Treatment: He can continue Crestor 20 mg once a day.\n\nHistory of coronary artery bypass grafting.\n\u2022 Medical Reasoning: He underwent coronary artery bypass grafting approximately 1 year ago. His coronary artery disease seems to be under control currently. He denies chest pain.\n\u2022 Additional Testing: We will do a stress test in 6 months.\n\nPatient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.\n</gold_response>\nCarefully review the <response> based on the <conversation> and compare it to the <gold_response> when needed.\n\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Does the note provide correct clinical information based on the conversation?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the note include all important medical details from the conversation?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the note written clearly and organized in a standard clinical format for clinicians\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS**\nThe patient, a 63-year-old female, presents for her routine yearly exam. She has a history of high blood pressure and depression, and had a carpal tunnel release done two years ago. She reports doing well with her depression, thanks to medication and weekly therapy sessions. She has been sleeping well and has no thoughts of hurting herself. However, she has been experiencing fluctuations in her blood pressure, with readings being either high or low over the past couple of weeks. She attributes this to stress at work and a poor diet, having been eating a lot of frozen meals. She also reports occasional headaches, which she attributes to looking at a computer screen all day.\n\n**2. PHYSICAL EXAM**\nThe patient's physical exam is essentially normal. Her lungs are clear, and she has no adenopathy in her neck or signs of hyperthyroidism. Her heart is regular without any murmurs, and her grips are equal. She is neurologically intact, with good strength and pulses. The exam reveals no numbness or tingling in her hands or fingers.\n\n**3. RESULTS**\nThe patient's vital signs show an elevated blood pressure reading in the office today. However, her lab results are essentially normal. The blood pressure reading is a concern, and the patient's medication may need to be adjusted.\n\n**4. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN**\nThe patient's assessment reveals that she still has hypertension, and her blood pressure medication may need to be increased. The plan is to increase her lisinopril to 10 milligrams a day, and have her check her blood pressure and return in a month for a follow-up appointment. Her depression is well-managed, and no changes to her medication are needed at this time. Her carpal tunnel release is doing well, and she is advised to report any tingling or changes in symptoms. The patient is otherwise doing well, and no other concerns or issues are noted.",

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS**\nThe patient, a 63-year-old female, presents for her routine yearly exam. She has a history of high blood pressure and depression, and had a carpal tunnel release done two years ago. She reports doing well with her depression, thanks to medication and weekly therapy sessions. She has been sleeping well and has no thoughts of hurting herself. However, she has been experiencing fluctuations in her blood pressure, with readings being either high or low over the past couple of weeks. She attributes this to stress at work and a poor diet, having been eating a lot of frozen meals. She also reports occasional headaches, which she attributes to looking at a computer screen all day.\n\n**2. PHYSICAL EXAM**\nThe patient's physical exam is essentially normal. Her lungs are clear, and she has no adenopathy in her neck or signs of hyperthyroidism. Her heart is regular without any murmurs, and her grips are equal. She is neurologically intact, with good strength and pulses. The exam reveals no numbness or tingling in her hands or fingers.\n\n**3. RESULTS**\nThe patient's vital signs show an elevated blood pressure reading in the office today. However, her lab results are essentially normal. The blood pressure reading is a concern, and the patient's medication may need to be adjusted.\n\n**4. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN**\nThe patient's assessment reveals that she still has hypertension, and her blood pressure medication may need to be increased. The plan is to increase her lisinopril to 10 milligrams a day, and have her check her blood pressure and return in a month for a follow-up appointment. Her depression is well-managed, and no changes to her medication are needed at this time. Her carpal tunnel release is doing well, and she is advised to report any tingling or changes in symptoms. The patient is otherwise doing well, and no other concerns or issues are noted.\n</response>\nThe reference note will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nCHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nAnnual exam.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nChristine Flores is a 63-year-old female presenting for her yearly exam.
