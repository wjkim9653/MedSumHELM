He reports significant improvement in his symptoms since starting protonix, stating that he is now able to eat whatever he wants without discomfort. He has made lifestyle modifications, including switching from caffeine to green tea and reducing his consumption of spicy foods and alcohol. He reports improved attitude and a great job performance, with a supportive family that checks in on him daily. He denies any current symptoms, including chest pain, shortness of breath, belly pain, nausea, or vomiting.\n\n**PHYSICAL EXAM**\n\nThe patient's vital signs are within normal limits, with good blood pressure control and a low heart rate. Physical examination reveals a slight 2/6 systolic ejection murmur, which is stable, and 1+ pitting edema bilaterally in the lower extremities, likely due to fluid retention from standing.\n\n**RESULTS**\n\nThe patient's endoscopy results from last year showed mild gastritis, which has improved significantly with protonix treatment. The patient's current endoscopy results are not mentioned in the conversation.\n\n**ASSESSMENT AND PLAN**\n\nThe patient's reflux symptoms have significantly improved with protonix treatment, and he is advised to continue taking 40 mg of protonix daily and maintain lifestyle modifications, including dietary changes. The patient is also encouraged to increase exercise to further improve his overall health. The nurse will check the patient out and finalize the note.",

Physical examination reveals a slight 2/6 systolic ejection murmur, which is stable, and 1+ pitting edema bilaterally in the lower extremities, likely due to fluid retention from standing.\n\n**RESULTS**\n\nThe patient's endoscopy results from last year showed mild gastritis, which has improved significantly with protonix treatment. The patient's current endoscopy results are not mentioned in the conversation.\n\n**ASSESSMENT AND PLAN**\n\nThe patient's reflux symptoms have significantly improved with protonix treatment, and he is advised to continue taking 40 mg of protonix daily and maintain lifestyle modifications, including dietary changes. The patient is also encouraged to increase exercise to further improve his overall health. The nurse will check the patient out and finalize the note.\n</response>\nThe reference note will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nCHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nFollow-up chronic problems.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nAlexander Myers is a 62-year-old male with a past medical history significant for reflux who presents for follow-up of his chronic problems.\n\nIn regards to his reflux, he reports that he has continued to utilize Protonix 40 mg daily.

while and then take it , it goes down . kind of like when i come here it's always high but then it goes down . in the mornings it's generally more normal where it's supposed to be .\n[doctor] uh- .\n[patient] mm , also i'm taking my medicine in the morning when i get up instead of in the evening .\n[doctor] yeah , so it sounds like we are not too far out of where we wan na be .\n[patient] right , mm-hmm .\n[doctor] okay . well let me get a listen to your heart , go ahead and hop up here .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] use my general exam template . all right , go ahead and take some deep breaths . okay , good . any fever , cough , shortness of breath or sore throat ?\n[patient] no .\n[doctor] any recent travel or contact or exposure to the coronavirus ?\n[patient] nope .\n[doctor] have you received your coronavirus vaccine ?\n[patient] yes , on february 9th .\n[doctor] okay , great . all right well i'm just going to look at your ankles and feet , i'm looking for any signs of swelling .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] all right , well everything looks good . you can go ahead and sit up miss taylor . all right , so the good news is everything is looking okay . i think we both agree if you were able to stop drinking your blood pressure would cease to be an issue for you .\n[patient] yeah i agree with that .\n[doctor] so let us discuss the potential medicine to help you with that . what it does is it blocks some of the brain receptors that alcohol stimulates and it tricks the brain into thinking it does not need alcohol , thereby cutting down the urges .\n[patient] the urge to drink or the constant thinking about it ?\n[doctor] it actually will help with both .\n[patient] okay . so is it like a one-time thing ?\n[doctor] generally the shot is given about once a month , it can also be given as a daily pill , but the shot does tend to work a bit better .\n[patient] yeah i've taken things like this in the past and if it is a pill , i know i wo n't take it . with a shot , it's not like you can un-take it .\n[doctor] yeah that's true . and the shot has been shown to work , it is more just a matter of getting you in to get your shot a month later with the nurse .\n[patient] yeah , sure , sure .\n[doctor] okay , so it's called naltrexone . i think the other name might be vivitrol . like i've said , the research on it is pretty good .\n[patient] i think i may have taken the naltrexone before .\n[doctor] okay , yeah , maybe you have .\n[patient] yeah , if it was available in a pill form then i'm almost certain i've tried it b- before .\n[doctor] okay . if this sounds good though , we can go ahead get you started with the shot . i am looking and it looks like we have you coming back in on may 17th for your first shot , does that sound good ?\n[patient] yeah , yeah , that sounds great . are there any possible side effects ?\n[doctor] yeah , some people will experience some nausea , headache , dizziness , anxi- anxiety , tiredness and trouble sleeping , but generally the side effects are mild and should go away within a few days .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] then we can schedule you for a follow-up in june to see how you are doing .\n[patient] all right that sounds good .\n[doctor] all right great . well otherwise stay with your current medicines , keep checking your blood pressure , and let's see if we can stop the alcohol for good . let us know if you have any questions or any issues come up after you receive the first dose .\n[patient] all right , sounds good , thank you .\n[doctor] you are welcome , have a good rest of your day .\n[patient] you too .\n[doctor] miss taylor is drinking alcohol four to five days per week to excess . no tobacco , no substance abuse , skin is moist , good trigger . on exam she is alert ,

History includes significant alcohol use disorder and mild hypercholesterolemia. At last visit on April 16, BP was 130/90. After presenting at 150/100 she was prescribed hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg by mouth once daily and lisinopril 20 mg by mouth once daily. CMP and CBC were essentially unremarkable.\n\nMrs. Taylor admits to consuming alcohol 4-5 times a week and is interested in Naltrexone injections. She acknowledges that her blood pressure would likely improve if she stopped alcohol consumption. She is checking her blood pressure in the morning and evening, stating it is higher at night but will improve after sitting for a few minutes. She is averaged 135-145 or 150 over 95-110.\n\nShe experienced side effects from lisinopril, such as headaches, \u201cswooshing\u201d in her left ear, and lethargy. She took half a dose and did not experience the side effects.\n\nPAST HISTORY\n\nMedical\nHypertension.\nHypercholesterolemia.\nAlcohol use disorder.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS\n\nLisinopril 20 mg tablet once daily.\nHydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg once daily.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nConstitutional\nNo distress.

History includes significant alcohol use disorder and mild hypercholesterolemia. At last visit on April 16, BP was 130/90. After presenting at 150/100 she was prescribed hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg by mouth once daily and lisinopril 20 mg by mouth once daily. CMP and CBC were essentially unremarkable.\n\nPLAN\n\nAlcohol use disorder\nI will start her on naltrexone which we have previously discussed. She will take the injectable form and start on May 17. We reviewed side effects and risks. The potential benefit of alcohol cessation would be highly beneficial to the patient.\n\nHypertension\nShe will continue taking lisinopril 10 mg/day and hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg daily. Quite possibly her blood pressure will improve significantly if she is able to completely stop consuming alcohol. Target BP is 130-140/70-80. I will see her back week of June 14 which likely will be the time of her second naltrexone injection.\n\nRecommend upgrading influenza vaccination and Shingrix #2, she defers this.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nCall the clinic with any questions.

            "text": "**HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS**\n\nA 72-year-old female patient, Amanda Taylor, presented for follow-up for hypertension. Her history includes significant alcohol use disorder and mild hypercholesterolemia. At her last visit on April 16th, her blood pressure was 130/90. She was prescribed hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg by mouth once daily and lisinopril 20 mg by mouth once daily. The patient reported struggling with not drinking and expressed a desire to discuss a shot mentioned at her previous visit. She reported drinking 4-5 times a week, with the last drink being on Monday. She has been taking her medications, but only taking half the dose of lisinopril due to side effects. She is taking the full dose of hydrochlorothiazide and has not experienced any chest tightness or shortness of breath. She is doing blood pressure checks at home, with readings ranging from 130-145/95-100 mmHg.\n\n**PHYSICAL EXAM**\n\nThe patient is alert, pleasant, and in no acute distress. She is not diabetic, with no tremor, no CVA tenderness, clear chest to percussion and auscultation, unlabored breathing, regular cardiac rhythm, no murmur, no gallop, and a flat JVP with a head at 90 degrees. She does not appear anxious, agitated, or depressed.\n\n**RESULTS**\n\nThe patient's blood pressure readings at home range from 130-145/95-100 mmHg. She has been taking her medications as prescribed, but only taking half the dose of lisinopril due to side effects. She has not experienced any chest tightness or shortness of breath.\n\n**ASSESSMENT AND PLAN**\n\nThe patient has a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder. She would like to start naltrexone, which we have previously discussed. She will take the injectable form and start on May 17th. We reviewed the side effects and risks of naltrexone. The potential benefit of alcohol cessation would be highly beneficial to her for many reasons, including hypertension. Her target blood pressure is 130-140/70-80 mmHg. I will see her back in the week of June 14th, which is likely around the time of her second naltrexone injection. I recommend upgrading her influenza vaccination and Shingrix, which she deferred.",

includes significant alcohol use disorder and mi- mild hypercholesterolemia . at last visit on april 16th her blood pressure was 130 over 90 . after presenting at 150 over 100 she was prescribed hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 milligrams by mouth once daily , and lisinopril 20 milligrams by mouth once daily . cmp and cbc were essentially unremarkable .\n[doctor] hi miss taylor , how are you today ?\n[patient] hi , i'm- i'm good , thank you .\n[doctor] thanks for coming in today .\n[patient] yeah , no problem .\n[doctor] so how have things been going for you ?\n[patient] uh , they've been all right . i'm struggling with not drinking . i wanted to discuss that , uh , shot that you had mentioned last time , but we did n't get to discuss it too much .\n[doctor] okay , well i'll be happy to provide you with more information . so tell me when did you last have a drink ?\n[patient] on monday .\n[doctor] okay , so you've gone a couple days without it ?\n[patient] yeah , yeah i have .\n[doctor] yeah , and had you been drinking for a while ?\n[patient] yep .\n[doctor] how much had- how much had you been drinking ?\n[patient] um , four or five times a week hard alcohol , so , you know .\n[doctor] okay . well it will certainly help your blood pressure if you're able to stop drinking .\n[patient] yeah , yeah i- i- i agree with you .\n[doctor] okay . are you taking your blood pressure medications ?\n[patient] yeah , but i'm only taking half of the lisinopril .\n[doctor] okay .\n[patient] i- b- well , the first time i took it i felt lethargic and tired , so i only took a half dose the next time . i felt much better and i did n't have the headaches or the swooshing that started in my left ear . so i feel like it's definitely helping but i do n't know ... i know it's not gon na be okay until i stop drinking .\n[doctor] and are you also taking the full dose of the hydrochlorothiazide ? do you have any , um , chest tightness or pressure or any shortness of breath ?\n[patient] yeah i'm taking the full dose of that medicine too , and no none of those symptoms .\n[doctor] okay . anything else i should be aware of or that we should be checking ?\n[patient] mm , no .\n[doctor] okay , good . are you doing the blood pressure checks at home ?\n[patient] yes . yes i am .\n[doctor] okay good . what kind of numbers are you seeing ?\n[patient] well , in the morning i'm seeing lower numbers than in the evening , um , where i run anywhere from like 130 to 145 or 150 over 95 to 100 on the bottom .\n[doctor] okay .\n[patient] but in the evenings if i sit there for a while and then take it , it goes down . kind of like when i come here it's always high but then it goes down . in the mornings it's generally more normal where it's supposed to be .\n[doctor] uh- .\n[patient] mm , also i'm taking my medicine in the morning when i get up instead of in the evening .\n[doctor] yeah , so it sounds like we are not too far out of where we wan na be .\n[patient] right , mm-hmm .\n[doctor] okay . well let me get a listen to your heart , go ahead and hop up here .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] use my general exam template . all right , go ahead and take some deep breaths . okay , good . any fever , cough , shortness of breath or sore throat ?\n[patient] no .\n[doctor] any recent travel or contact or exposure to the coronavirus ?\n[patient] nope .\n[doctor] have you received your coronavirus vaccine ?\n[patient] yes , on february 9th .\n[doctor] okay , great . all right well i'm just going to look at your ankles and feet , i'm looking for any signs of swelling .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] all right , well everything looks good . you can go ahead and sit up miss taylor . all right , so the good news is everything is looking okay . i think we both agree if you were able to stop drinking your blood pressure would cease to be an issue for you .\n[patient] yeah i agree with that .\n[doctor] so let us discuss the potential medicine to help you with that . what it does is it blocks some of the brain receptors that alcohol stimulates and it tricks the brain into thinking it does not need alcohol , thereby cutting down the urges .\n[patient] the urge to drink or the constant thinking about it ?\n[doctor] it actually will help with both .\n[patient] okay . so is it like a one-time thing ?\n[doctor] generally the shot is given about once a month , it can also be given as a daily pill , but the shot does tend to work a bit better .\n[patient] yeah i've taken things like this in the past and if it is a pill , i know i wo n't take it . with a shot , it's not like you can un-take it .\n[doctor] yeah that's true . and the shot has been shown to work , it is more just a matter of getting you in to get your shot a month later with the nurse .\n[patient] yeah , sure , sure .\n[doctor] okay , so it's called naltrexone . i think the other name might be vivitrol . like i've said , the research on it is pretty good .\n[patient] i think i may have taken the naltrexone before .\n[doctor] okay , yeah , maybe you have .\n[patient] yeah , if it was available in a pill form then i'm almost certain i've tried it b- before .\n[doctor] okay . if this sounds good though , we can go ahead get you started with the shot . i am looking and it looks like we have you coming back in on may 17th for your first shot , does that sound good ?\n[patient] yeah , yeah , that sounds great . are there any possible side effects ?\n[doctor] yeah , some people will experience some nausea , headache , dizziness , anxi- anxiety , tiredness and trouble sleeping , but generally the side effects are mild and should go away within a few days .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] then we can schedule you for a follow-up in june to see how you are doing .\n[patient] all right that sounds good .\n[doctor] all right great . well otherwise stay with your current medicines , keep checking your blood pressure , and let's see if we can stop the alcohol for good . let us know if you have any questions or any issues come up after you receive the first dose .\n[patient] all right , sounds good , thank you .\n[doctor] you are welcome , have a good rest of

patient, Amanda Taylor, presented for follow-up for hypertension. Her history includes significant alcohol use disorder and mild hypercholesterolemia. At her last visit on April 16th, her blood pressure was 130/90. She was prescribed hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg by mouth once daily and lisinopril 20 mg by mouth once daily. The patient reported struggling with not drinking and expressed a desire to discuss a shot mentioned at her previous visit. She reported drinking 4-5 times a week, with the last drink being on Monday. She has been taking her medications, but only taking half the dose of lisinopril due to side effects. She is taking the full dose of hydrochlorothiazide and has not experienced any chest tightness or shortness of breath. She is doing blood pressure checks at home, with readings ranging from 130-145/95-100 mmHg.\n\n**PHYSICAL EXAM**\n\nThe patient is alert, pleasant, and in no acute distress. She is not diabetic, with no tremor, no CVA tenderness, clear chest to percussion and auscultation, unlabored breathing, regular cardiac rhythm, no murmur, no gallop, and a flat JVP with a head at 90 degrees. She does not appear anxious, agitated, or depressed.\n\n**RESULTS**\n\nThe patient's blood pressure readings at home range from 130-145/95-100 mmHg. She has been taking her medications as prescribed, but only taking half the dose of lisinopril due to side effects. She has not experienced any chest tightness or shortness of breath.\n\n**ASSESSMENT AND PLAN**\n\nThe patient has a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder. She would like to start naltrexone, which we have previously discussed. She will take the injectable form and start on May 17th. We reviewed the side effects and risks of naltrexone. The potential benefit of alcohol cessation would be highly beneficial to her for many reasons, including hypertension. Her target blood pressure is 130-140/70-80 mmHg. I will see her back in the week of June 14th, which is likely around the time of her second naltrexone injection. I recommend upgrading her influenza vaccination and Shingrix, which she deferred.\n</response>\nThe reference note will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nCHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nHypertension.\nAlcohol use disorder.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nAmanda Taylor is an 72-year-old woman who presents for a follow-up for hypertension.

After presenting at 150/100 she was prescribed hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg by mouth once daily and lisinopril 20 mg by mouth once daily. CMP and CBC were essentially unremarkable.\n\nPLAN\n\nAlcohol use disorder\nI will start her on naltrexone which we have previously discussed. She will take the injectable form and start on May 17. We reviewed side effects and risks. The potential benefit of alcohol cessation would be highly beneficial to the patient.\n\nHypertension\nShe will continue taking lisinopril 10 mg/day and hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg daily. Quite possibly her blood pressure will improve significantly if she is able to completely stop consuming alcohol. Target BP is 130-140/70-80. I will see her back week of June 14 which likely will be the time of her second naltrexone injection.\n\nRecommend upgrading influenza vaccination and Shingrix #2, she defers this.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nCall the clinic with any questions. Make follow up appointment week of June 14th.\n\n</gold_response>\nCarefully review the <response> based on the <conversation> and compare it to the <gold_response> when needed.\n\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Does the note provide correct clinical information based on the conversation?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the note include all important medical details from the conversation?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the note written clearly and organized in a standard clinical format for clinicians\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n"

She says that the right side of her vagina is starting to become painful but denies any fever or chills. She states that she recently learned her partner of 3 years has been engaging in sexual encounters with other people for quite some time, and she wants to be evaluated for all sexually transmitted diseases.\n\nMs. Ross reports noticing a change in the odor, color, and consistency of her vaginal discharge last week. She notes that this did not alarm her until the right side of her vagina became painful and sore, which has not subsided. She states that she had an abnormal Pap Smear around the age of 20, but all her Pap Smears since then, including her most recent one approximately 6 months ago, have all been normal.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nGenitourinary\nPelvic exam: No external lesions, normal labia majora and labia minora. Normal physiological discharge with normal color and odor. Cervix is normal, vaginal wall is normal, no cervical motion tenderness or masses noted. Swabs were obtained for sexual transmitted disease testing.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\n\u2022 Screening for sexually transmitted disease.\n\nPLAN\n\nMs. Ross is a 23-year-old female who presents today as a new patient for full-spectrum STD testing.

She reports a change in vaginal discharge, discomfort, and odor in her vaginal region, specifically on the right side, which has been painful for an unknown duration. She denies any fevers or chills. The patient recently discovered that her boyfriend has been unfaithful, and she is concerned about the possibility of contracting an STD. She reports a history of a normal Pap smear 6 months ago and an irregular Pap smear at age 20.\n\n**PHYSICAL EXAM**\n\nThe patient's physical exam revealed no external lesions, normal labia majora and labia minora, normal physiological discharge with normal color and smell. The pelvic exam demonstrated a normal cervix, vaginal wall, and no cervical motion tenderness or adnexal tenderness or masses. Swabs were taken for STD testing.\n\n**RESULTS**\n\nThe results of the physical exam are pending, but the patient has been scheduled for STD testing for gonorrhea, chlamydia, trichomoniasis, syphilis, HIV, and hepatitis C. The patient will be contacted if any abnormal results are found, and she is advised to call the clinic in 3 days for results.\n\n**ASSESSMENT AND PLAN**\n\nAssessment: Screen for STD.\n\nPlan: The patient is at high risk for STDs due to her abnormal Pap smear in the past and her partner's history of infidelity. She has been scheduled for STD testing, and the results will be communicated to her in 3 days. If the results are normal, she will be seen at her next annual checkup.",

She reports a change in vaginal discharge, discomfort, and odor in her vaginal region, specifically on the right side, which has been painful for an unknown duration. She denies any fevers or chills. The patient recently discovered that her boyfriend has been unfaithful, and she is concerned about the possibility of contracting an STD. She reports a history of a normal Pap smear 6 months ago and an irregular Pap smear at age 20.\n\n**PHYSICAL EXAM**\n\nThe patient's physical exam revealed no external lesions, normal labia majora and labia minora, normal physiological discharge with normal color and smell. The pelvic exam demonstrated a normal cervix, vaginal wall, and no cervical motion tenderness or adnexal tenderness or masses. Swabs were taken for STD testing.\n\n**RESULTS**\n\nThe results of the physical exam are pending, but the patient has been scheduled for STD testing for gonorrhea, chlamydia, trichomoniasis, syphilis, HIV, and hepatitis C. The patient will be contacted if any abnormal results are found, and she is advised to call the clinic in 3 days for results.\n\n**ASSESSMENT AND PLAN**\n\nAssessment: Screen for STD.\n\nPlan: The patient is at high risk for STDs due to her abnormal Pap smear in the past and her partner's history of infidelity. She has been scheduled for STD testing, and the results will be communicated to her in 3 days. If the results are normal, she will be seen at her next annual checkup.\n</response>\nThe reference note will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nCHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nFull-spectrum sexually transmitted disease testing.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nMs. Ross is a 23-year-old female who presents today as a new patient for full-spectrum STD testing.\n\nThe patient states that she is having symptoms of discomfort, a change in discharge, and an odor in her vaginal region. She says that the right side of her vagina is starting to become painful but denies any fever or chills. She states that she recently learned her partner of 3 years has been engaging in sexual encounters with other people for quite some time, and she wants to be evaluated for all sexually transmitted diseases.\n\nMs. Ross reports noticing a change in the odor, color, and consistency of her vaginal discharge last week. She notes that this did not alarm her until the right side of her vagina became painful and sore, which has not subsided. She states that she had an abnormal Pap Smear around the age of 20, but all her Pap Smears since then, including her most recent one approximately 6 months ago, have all been normal.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nGenitourinary\nPelvic exam: No external lesions, normal labia majora and labia minora. Normal physiological discharge with normal color and odor. Cervix is normal, vaginal wall is normal, no cervical motion tenderness or masses noted. Swabs were obtained for sexual transmitted disease testing.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\n\u2022 Screening for sexually transmitted disease.\n\nPLAN\n\nMs. Ross is a 23-year-old female who presents today as a new patient for full-spectrum STD testing. We will screen her today for gonorrhea, chlamydia, trichomoniasis, syphilis, HIV, and hepatitis C. Patient is high risk due to an abnormal pap smear in the past and the recent discovery of her sexual partner having multiple partners for some period of time. We will call the patient with the results of the laboratory testing.\n</gold_response>\nCarefully review the <response> based on the <conversation> and compare it to the <gold_response> when needed.\n\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Does the note provide correct clinical information based on the conversation?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the note include all important medical details from the conversation?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the note written clearly and organized in a standard clinical format for clinicians\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n"

I have recommended taking ibuprofen 600 mg three times per day for one week. If the patient does not have relief from the ibuprofen she will take Aleve. The patient may also utilize ice or heat packs. She should rest her left arm and may not lift or carry heavy objects with her left arm. The patient should follow up in three to four weeks if the pain persists. We may repeat the left shoulder x-ray at that time.\n"

She reported that the pain started after a gymnastics class, where she may have toppled over into an awkward position. She denied taking any pain medications initially but took Tylenol for 2-3 days without relief. She has a past history of surgery on her left arm, but the doctor does not believe it is related to her current pain.\n\n**PHYSICAL EXAM**\n\nThe patient's left shoulder pain was exacerbated by movement, including moving up and back. The doctor examined the patient and found that any movement of the left shoulder caused pain. The doctor reviewed the patient's x-ray, which showed no signs of a broken bone or fracture.\n\n**RESULTS**\n\nThe x-ray of the left shoulder did not show any signs of a broken bone or fracture. The doctor suspects that the patient may have hurt her joint.\n\n**ASSESSMENT AND PLAN**\n\nAssessment: The patient has left shoulder pain that started after a gymnastics class and is exacerbated by movement. The x-ray shows no signs of a broken bone or fracture.\n\nPlan: The doctor recommends continuing to use pain relievers, specifically 600mg of ibuprofen three times a day for a week. The patient is advised to rest her left arm while it heals and avoid heavy lifting or using her left arm for the next 3-4 weeks. The patient is to follow up in 3 weeks if the pain persists. The doctor also suggests using ice or a heat pad to relieve pain if needed.",

She reported that the pain started after a gymnastics class, where she may have toppled over into an awkward position. She denied taking any pain medications initially but took Tylenol for 2-3 days without relief. She has a past history of surgery on her left arm, but the doctor does not believe it is related to her current pain.\n\n**PHYSICAL EXAM**\n\nThe patient's left shoulder pain was exacerbated by movement, including moving up and back. The doctor examined the patient and found that any movement of the left shoulder caused pain. The doctor reviewed the patient's x-ray, which showed no signs of a broken bone or fracture.\n\n**RESULTS**\n\nThe x-ray of the left shoulder did not show any signs of a broken bone or fracture. The doctor suspects that the patient may have hurt her joint.\n\n**ASSESSMENT AND PLAN**\n\nAssessment: The patient has left shoulder pain that started after a gymnastics class and is exacerbated by movement. The x-ray shows no signs of a broken bone or fracture.\n\nPlan: The doctor recommends continuing to use pain relievers, specifically 600mg of ibuprofen three times a day for a week. The patient is advised to rest her left arm while it heals and avoid heavy lifting or using her left arm for the next 3-4 weeks. The patient is to follow up in 3 weeks if the pain persists. The doctor also suggests using ice or a heat pad to relieve pain if needed.\n</response>\nThe reference note will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nCC:\n\nLeft shoulder pain.\n\nHPI:\n\nMs. Anderson is a 44-year-old female who presents today for an evaluation of the left shoulder. She states that she was in gymnastics 1 week ago. The pain has been present since that time. She has pain with any type of movement of her left shoulder. She had taken Tylenol for 2 to 3 days with no improvement in her symptoms.\n\nShe has a surgical history significant for prior left upper extremity surgery.\n\nEXAM\n\nExamination of the left shoulder shows pain with range of motion.\n\nRESULTS\n\nX-rays of the left shoulder, 3 views obtained on today's visit show no obvious signs of fracture.\n\nPLAN\n\nAt this point, I discussed the diagnosis and treatment options with the patient. I have recommended taking ibuprofen 600 mg three times per day for one week. If the patient does not have relief from the ibuprofen she will take Aleve. The patient may also utilize ice or heat packs. She should rest her left arm and may not lift or carry heavy objects with her left arm. The patient should follow up in three to four weeks if the pain persists. We may repeat the left shoulder x-ray at that time.\n\n</gold_response>\nCarefully review the <response> based on the <conversation> and compare it to the <gold_response> when needed.\n\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Does the note provide correct clinical information based on the conversation?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the note include all important medical details from the conversation?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the note written clearly and organized in a standard clinical format for clinicians\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n"

?\n[patient] i'm pretty . good . how are you ?\n[doctor] good as well . so it sounds like we're , um , under good control right now .\n[patient] yes . it's doing much better .\n[doctor] good , good . do you have any rash leftover ?\n[patient] yeah , i have a- a small bit leftover . i started using , uh , doxycycline only one a day because i think the pharmacist said if it's getting better , to just limit it to once a day .\n[doctor] okay , that sounds good .\n[patient] but i was taking it twice a day and i did notice a lotta improvement .\n[doctor] okay .\n[patient] and then when i started doing it only once a day , it seems the same and it's not continuing to get better . so it's kinda plateaued a little bit .\n[doctor] i see . um , are you breastfeeding at this time ?\n[patient] no , i'm not right now .\n[doctor] okay , good . so you- you should not be breastfeeding while you're on that medication .\n[patient] yeah , actually i stopped breastfeeding and then asked for the doxycycline at that time .\n[doctor] okay . even with the doxycycline , you can keep using the elidel .\n[patient] okay . and i did n't take the elidel because when i read about it i got worried . so i wanted to just try the doxycycline and see .\n[doctor] okay . so we can talk about the elidel . a lot of the things you read about is not actually relevant to the cream or ointment form , but it's about the oral form that's used in really high doses , longterm , after people have a heart transplant or a kidney transplant or something like that .\n[patient] okay . i did n't realize that .\n[doctor] yeah , and when you suppress the immune system that hard for that long , it can predispose you for developing cancers like hematologic type cancers . it does n't apply to as-needed use of the medicine , a cream or an ointment , okay ?\n[patient] okay . then i can resume taking - taking the doxycycline twice a day again ?\n[doctor] so let me clarify . what exactly are you using ? and then we'll look at you and figure out , okay ? so you're using the sulfacetamide wash ? uh , how frequently are you using that one ?\n[patient] twice a day .\n[doctor] okay , and that's not drying you out too much ?\n[patient] no , that's fine .\n[doctor] okay . and you're using the metro cream ?\n[patient] yes .\n[doctor] how often are you using that one ?\n[patient] after my face wash , i immediately apply the cream .\n[doctor] okay . and then , are you using any other kind of lotions or anything ?\n[patient] no .\n[doctor] so you're not using the cetaphil cleanser ?\n[patient] i'm not .\n[doctor] okay . and no neutrogena wipes ?\n[patient] no wipes .\n[doctor] okay . um , and then what about , um , any lotions that you're using ?\n[patient] i'm not using any lotion right now , just those two .\n[doctor] no lotion , okay . so that may be something else we should add in , a lotion to just help moisturize . but we'll see .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] um , and then again , when did you go down to just taking the doxycycline once a day ?\n[patient] that was last week . so the first two weeks , i did twice a day .\n[doctor] okay .\n[patient] and then i started seeing improvement , and then i changed to just once a day .\n[doctor] okay . let me take a look at your face here . i'm gon na describe for the transcriptionist what i'm seeing . you're fitzpatrick skin type iv , meaning you're not going to burn , you're going to sun tan , um , essentially , iv to v. and then on bilateral medial cheeks , there are a few really faint erythematous papules and just maybe a little bit of redness around and underneath your nostrils . so you're right , it's not totally gone .\n[patient] yeah .\n[doctor] i think i would go ahead and go back to twice a day , every day , with the doxycycline .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] uh , but i would pickup the elidel too .\n[patient] okay , i can do that .\n[doctor] i mean , out of known risks associated with medications , topicals are usually safer and preferable to oral medications . with that being said , doxycycline is low risk .\n[patient] it is ? okay .\n[doctor] um , and doxycycline can give you bad upset stomach or heartburn . um , it will make you sunburn , even if you never sunburn , so you have to protect yourself .\n[patient] yeah , i mean , i feel sun sensitive whenever i go out , so i am taking all the precautions , with wearing a hat and all of that .\n[doctor] great . i just wanted to make sure you knew about that .\n[patient] yes , i did . thank you .\n[doctor] all right . but i think to help get rid of it sooner rather than later , if insurance will cover the elidel , pick it up and start using it .\n[patient] yeah , i did check . the insurance is not covering it .\n[doctor] it's not ? okay . well , let's look around really quick because if you use a goodrx coupon , it will be around 30 to $ 40 or something .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] let's see .\n[patient] so with your coupon , it was around $ 850 or something .\n[doctor] ugh , yeah . that's way too much .\n[patient] i agree . and- and because i also looked at the eucrisa that you recommended in my notes , and if it's still ex- if it's still expensive , i could try that instead .\n[doctor] yeah , so it ... actually ... it is actually more expensive . i think the prices fluctuate .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] because now it's showing the cheapest of $ 70 , and when i looked before , it was around 30 to $ 40 .\n[patient] yeah . if it was around $ 200 , i would've picked it up . but it was coming to around $ 850 after insurance .\n[doctor] okay . so i've found the cream form . we could try ointment form .\n[patient] you mean the tacrolimus ?\n[doctor] yeah , mm-hmm .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] so if we send it to pick'n save or metro market ... let's see where else .\n[patient] can you do the metro market ?\n[doctor] yeah . let me put in the prescription and we'll see what we can find .\n[patient] sure .\n[doctor] pharmacy is what i'm trying to say .\n[patient] okay . but it's not a steroid , right ?\n[doctor] correct , it's not a steroid .\n[patient] okay , good .\n[doctor] it's called a calcineurin inhibitor . it's kinda like a steroid in that it calms inflammation .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] but it's not a steroid , so do n't use steroids on your face , for sure , as they'll make this kind of rash worse . but also , steroids carry the risk of causing thinning of the skin .\n[patient] all right .\n[doctor] these medications do n't cause thinning of the skin and they're not going to cause some other kind of rash . um , the thing to know is that sometimes five to 10 minutes after you put it on , it can cause this weird kind of tingly or needle-like sensation or make it redder or flush . but it should only last a few seconds and then go away . it's not an allergy or anything bad .\n[patient] okay . got it .\n[doctor] so it only lasts a couple seconds . it does n't mean it's going to happen again . it's nothing bad . it will still work , so keep using it as long as you know you can stand it , okay ?\n[patient] okay , thank you for explaining .\n[doctor] so i will say , \" apply to rash on face twice daily , until resolved . \"\n[patient] okay . so only apply to the rash area ?\n[doctor] yes , and keep using the face wash.\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] i think you could just do it once a day . i do n't think you need to do it twice a day , just because i do n't wan na dry your sky out too much , okay ?\n[patient] i never noticed that my face is dry or got thin . i feel so good after using it .\n[doctor] i understand , but it could get dry and i do n't wan na create other problems for you .\n[patient] all right . i'll just wash once a day with it . but it was feeling very good , like there's this little bit of moisture getting back in . with the other wash , when i would use it twice a day , i was drying out . but not with this one .\n[doctor] i see . okay . well then do what feels good . if you do notice that you're starting to get dry , then reduce to once per day .\n[patient] that sounds good .\n[doctor] so to review , um , continue using the same face wash , continue with metro cream , and increase the use of doxycycline to twice a day .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] and then just do it until it's gone , and then do it for once a day for another week before stopping .\n[patient] okay , sounds good .\n[doctor] all right . and i'll rewrite your instructions here .\n[patient] thank you so much .\n[doctor] if there are any other questions or you're getting different instructions , feel free to reach out to me and we'll clarify , okay ?\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] but in general , doxycycline is such a low risk . we're not gon na have you on this forever . but especially since we're adding the tacrolimus , i expect it will clear quickly .\n[patient] sounds good .\n[doctor] all right . and i just wan na really help knock it out as fast as possible , since you've been dealing with it for so long now . i would take it twice a day until it's gone , and then once a day for a week before you stop . i'll write it out like that . so twice a day until rash is gone , and then once a day for another week before stopping .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] once the rash stops , you can stop the tacrolimus ointment . um , continue doxycycline another week and then stop . but you can keep using the wash and the metro cream .\n[patient] okay , that sounds good . i can do that .\n[doctor] and then hold off until i see you again before you start back any of your old products . um , if it's starting to flair again , um , if it's just a little bit , you can try just doing the tacrolimus for a couple days , to see if that's enough . if it's not , then restart the dy- doxycycline as well .\n[patient] all right .\n[doctor] i do n't expect that to happen , but , you know , if it does , you have the tools . um , then you'll be seeing me for a followup . we can figure out what to do next . i would say if it's getting worse rather than better , just give me a call or send me a mychart message , okay ?\n[patient] yeah , sounds good .\n[doctor] do you have enough refills ?\n[patient] yeah , i think so .\n[doctor] okay . so it looks like you have another refill of the doxycycline , so you're good there . metro cream , you probably still have enough of that one .\n[patient] yes , i do .\n[doctor] all right . and i'll cancel the elidel cream , just so we do n't complicate your list . uh , you have plenty of the face wash still .\n[patient] yes .\n[doctor] okay . uh , and we'll get rid of the clindamycin from your list as well .\n[patient] and what would you suggest for a moisturizer ?\n[doctor] yeah , so for that i would do something really basic like vanicream . or even , if it's just really dry , you could use a little bit of petroleum jelly . um , i'll give you a couple samples , okay ? let's make sure we have a followup in about four weeks .\n[patient] okay , thank you .\n[doctor] okay . and i would stay away from any kind of anti-aging thing , any kind of plant thing . um , really let's just be sure we talk about any new products , or reach out to me if you're gon na try something else . um , let's go get those samples .\n[patient] okay , that sounds good .\n[doctor] for assessment and plan , perioral dermatitis , rosacea , including ocular rosacea , and copy and paste her patient instructions . i recommend that she gently wash her eyelids once a day with gentle cleanser such as vanicream , also use bruder mask as needed

She also has a history of rosacea, including ocular rosacea. Today, she states that her perioral dermatitis is well-controlled, although it has not fully resolved. The patient was applying doxycycline twice a day with improvement, but her pharmacist advised her to reduce to once daily since it had started to improve; therefore, for approximately the past week, she has been using the doxycycline only once per day. She has not seen continued improvement but it has not worsened. She is using the sulfacetamide wash twice daily, denies drying of the skin, and reports that her skin is much improved moisturization. She also applies MetroCream immediately after using the sulfacetamide wash. She denies using other lotions and products, Cetaphil lotion or soap, or Neutrogena wipes. The patient did not begin Elidel because it is not covered by her insurance, and she was concerned about possible side effects from the medication.\n\nPAST HISTORY\n\nMedical\nPerioral dermatitis.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS\n\nDoxycycline cream. Apply twice daily.\nMetroCream. \nSulfacetamide wash. Apply topically twice daily.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nIntegumentary\nSkin inspection of the face was performed today. On bilateral medial cheeks, there are a few, very faint, erythematous papules with mild redness around and underneath the nostrils. Fitzpatrick skin type is 4 to 5.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\n\u2022 Perioral dermatitis\n\u2022 Rosacea, including ocular rosacea\n\nJacqueline Miller is a 40-year-old female who presented today for follow-up for her perioral dermatitis, which has improved but not resolved. She decreased her doxycycline per her pharmacist\u2019s recommendation, which possibly stagnated the resolution of symptoms.\n\nPLAN\n\nPerioral dermatitis.\nI counseled the patient about the risks and benefits of doxycycline and recommended she resume twice daily application until she reaches full resolution, and at that point she should reduce application to once a day for an additional week. The patient will not be using Elidel as I reviewed the cost of the medication and without insurance, it was too expensive. I provided a prescription for Tacrolimus and counseled her on possible side effects of using the medication. She will continue with Sulfacetamide face wash once a day. Also, use Bruder mask as needed.\n\nRosacea, including ocular rosacea.\nContinue using MetroCream twice daily. I recommended to gently wash her eyelids once daily with a gentle cleanser and try a gentle cream such as Vanicream.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nCall the clinic if symptoms worsen. The patient will have a follow-up appointment in 4 weeks."

.\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] um , and then again , when did you go down to just taking the doxycycline once a day ?\n[patient] that was last week . so the first two weeks , i did twice a day .\n[doctor] okay .\n[patient] and then i started seeing improvement , and then i changed to just once a day .\n[doctor] okay . let me take a look at your face here . i'm gon na describe for the transcriptionist what i'm seeing . you're fitzpatrick skin type iv , meaning you're not going to burn , you're going to sun tan , um , essentially , iv to v. and then on bilateral medial cheeks , there are a few really faint erythematous papules and just maybe a little bit of redness around and underneath your nostrils . so you're right , it's not totally gone .\n[patient] yeah .\n[doctor] i think i would go ahead and go back to twice a day , every day , with the doxycycline .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] uh , but i would pickup the elidel too .\n[patient] okay , i can do that .\n[doctor] i mean , out of known risks associated with medications , topicals are usually safer and preferable to oral medications . with that being said , doxycycline is low risk .\n[patient] it is ? okay .\n[doctor] um , and doxycycline can give you bad upset stomach or heartburn . um , it will make you sunburn , even if you never sunburn , so you have to protect yourself .\n[patient] yeah , i mean , i feel sun sensitive whenever i go out , so i am taking all the precautions , with wearing a hat and all of that .\n[doctor] great . i just wanted to make sure you knew about that .\n[patient] yes , i did . thank you .\n[doctor] all right . but i think to help get rid of it sooner rather than later , if insurance will cover the elidel , pick it up and start using it .\n[patient] yeah , i did check . the insurance is not covering it .\n[doctor] it's not ? okay . well , let's look around really quick because if you use a goodrx coupon , it will be around 30 to $ 40 or something .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] let's see .\n[patient] so with your coupon , it was around $ 850 or something .\n[doctor] ugh , yeah . that's way too much .\n[patient] i agree . and- and because i also looked at the eucrisa that you recommended in my notes , and if it's still ex- if it's still expensive , i could try that instead .\n[doctor] yeah , so it ... actually ... it is actually more expensive . i think the prices fluctuate .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] because now it's showing the cheapest of $ 70 , and when i looked before , it was around 30 to $ 40 .\n[patient] yeah . if it was around $ 200 , i would've picked it up . but it was coming to around $ 850 after insurance .\n[doctor] okay . so i've found the cream form . we could try ointment form .\n[patient] you mean the tacrolimus ?\n[doctor] yeah , mm-hmm .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] so if we send it to pick'n save or metro market ... let's see where else .\n[patient] can you do the metro market ?\n[doctor] yeah . let me put in the prescription and we'll see what we can find .\n[patient] sure .\n[doctor] pharmacy is what i'm trying to say .\n[patient] okay . but it's not a steroid , right ?\n[doctor] correct , it's not a steroid .\n[patient] okay , good .\n[doctor] it's called a calcineurin inhibitor . it's kinda like a steroid in that it calms inflammation .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] but it's not a steroid , so do n't use steroids on your face , for sure , as they'll make this kind of rash worse . but also , steroids carry the risk of causing thinning of the skin .\n[patient] all right .\n[doctor] these medications do n't cause thinning of the skin and they're not going to cause some other kind of rash . um , the thing to know is that sometimes five to 10 minutes after you put it on , it can cause this weird kind of tingly or needle-like sensation or make it redder or flush . but it should only last a few seconds and then go away . it's not an allergy or anything bad .\n[patient] okay . got it .\n[doctor] so it only lasts a couple seconds . it does n't mean it's going to happen again . it's nothing bad . it will still work , so keep using it as long as you know you can stand it , okay ?\n[patient] okay , thank you for explaining .\n[doctor] so i will say , \" apply to rash on face twice daily , until resolved . \"\n[patient] okay . so only apply to the rash area ?\n[doctor] yes , and keep using the face wash.\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] i think you could just do it once a day . i do n't think you need to do it twice a day , just because i do n't wan na dry your sky out too much , okay ?\n[patient] i never noticed that my face is dry or got thin . i feel so good after using it .\n[doctor] i understand , but it could get dry and i do n't wan na create other problems for you .\n[patient] all right . i'll just wash once a day with it . but it was feeling very good , like there's this little bit of moisture getting back in . with the other wash , when i would use it twice a day , i was drying out . but not with this one .\n[doctor] i see . okay . well then do what feels good . if you do notice that you're starting to get dry , then reduce to once per day .\n[patient] that sounds good .\n[doctor] so to review , um , continue using the same face wash , continue with metro cream , and increase the use of doxycycline to twice a day .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] and then just do it until it's gone , and then do it for once a day for another week before stopping .\n[patient] okay , sounds good .\n[doctor] all right . and i'll rewrite your instructions here .\n[patient] thank you so much .\n[doctor] if there are any other questions or you're getting different instructions , feel free to reach out to me and we'll clarify , okay ?\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] but in general , doxycycline is such a low risk . we're not gon na have you on this forever . but especially since we're adding the tacrolimus , i expect it will clear quickly .\n[patient] sounds good .\n[doctor] all right . and i just wan na really help knock it out as fast as possible , since you've been dealing with it for so long now . i would take it twice a day until it's gone , and then once a day for a week before you stop . i'll write it out like that . so twice a day until rash is gone , and then once a day for another week before stopping .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] once the rash stops , you can stop the tacrolimus ointment . um , continue doxycycline another week and then stop . but you can keep using the wash and the metro cream .\n[patient] okay , that sounds good . i can do that .\n[doctor] and then hold off until i see you again before you start back any of your old products . um , if it's starting to flair again , um , if it's just a little bit , you can try just doing the tacrolimus for a couple days , to see if that's enough . if it's not , then restart the dy- doxycycline as well .\n[patient] all right .\n[doctor] i do n't expect that to happen , but , you know , if it does , you have the tools . um , then you'll be seeing me for a followup . we can figure out what to do next . i would say if it's getting worse rather than better , just give me a call or send me a mychart message , okay ?\n[patient] yeah , sounds good .\n[doctor] do you have enough refills ?\n[patient] yeah , i think so .\n[doctor] okay . so it looks like you have another refill of the doxycycline , so you're good there . metro cream , you probably still have enough of that one .\n[patient] yes , i do .\n[doctor] all right . and i'll cancel the elidel cream , just so we do n't complicate your list . uh , you have plenty of the face wash still .\n[patient] yes .\n[doctor] okay . uh , and we'll get rid of the clindamycin from your list as well .\n[patient] and what would you suggest for a moisturizer ?\n[doctor] yeah , so for that i would do something really basic like vanicream . or even , if it's just really dry , you could use a little bit of petroleum jelly . um , i'll give you a couple samples , okay ? let's make sure we have a followup in about four weeks .\n[patient] okay , thank you .\n[doctor] okay . and i would stay away from any kind of anti-aging thing , any kind of plant thing . um , really let's just be sure we talk about any new products , or reach out to me if you're gon na try something else . um , let's go get those samples .\n[patient] okay , that sounds good .\n[doctor] for assessment and plan , perioral dermatitis , rosacea , including ocular rosacea , and copy and paste her patient instructions . i recommend that she gently wash her eyelids once a day with gentle cleanser such as vanicream , also use bruder mask as needed .\nClinical Note:",

She reported that her condition had improved significantly after starting doxycycline, but had plateaued when she reduced the dosage to once a day. She had been using the sulfacetamide wash twice a day and the metro cream after washing her face. She had stopped breastfeeding and was not currently taking any other medications. She had concerns about the elidel cream due to misinformation she had read, but the doctor explained that the oral form of the medication has different risks compared to the topical form.\n\n**PHYSICAL EXAM**\n\nThe patient's Fitzpatrick skin type is IV-V, indicating a moderate skin type that tans easily. Examination revealed faint erythematous papules on the bilateral medial cheeks and redness around and underneath the nostrils. The doctor noted that the rash was not completely gone.\n\n**RESULTS**\n\nThe patient's condition had improved significantly after starting doxycycline, but had plateaued when the dosage was reduced to once a day. The doctor recommended increasing the dosage to twice a day and adding the tacrolimus ointment to help clear the rash more quickly.\n\n**ASSESSMENT AND PLAN**\n\nDiagnosis: Perioral dermatitis and rosacea, including ocular rosacea.\n\nPlan:\n\n* Continue using the sulfacetamide wash once a day.\n* Apply the metro cream to the rash area twice a day until the rash is gone, then once a day for another week before stopping.\n* Increase the dosage of doxycycline to twice a day.\n* Add the tacrolimus ointment to the treatment plan, applying it to the rash area twice a day until the rash is gone, then once a day for another week before stopping.\n* Continue using the doxycycline for another week after the rash is gone.\n* Use a gentle cleanser, such as vanicream, to wash the eyelids once a day.\n* Use a Bruder mask as needed.\n* Avoid using any anti-aging or plant-based products.\n* Follow-up appointment in four weeks.\n* If the rash flares up, try using the tacrolimus ointment for a few days to see if it resolves, and restart the doxycycline if necessary.",

captures the clinical information from the conversation and\ncompare it to the reference note (gold standard) in terms of accruacy, completeness and clarity.\nThe conversation will be provided in these tags:\n<conversation>\nDoctor-patient dialogue:\n\n[doctor] uh , mrn49282721 . patient's name is jacqueline miller . use last visit exam where appropriate .\n[doctor] hi , how are you doing , jacqueline ?\n[patient] i'm pretty . good . how are you ?\n[doctor] good as well . so it sounds like we're , um , under good control right now .\n[patient] yes . it's doing much better .\n[doctor] good , good . do you have any rash leftover ?\n[patient] yeah , i have a- a small bit leftover . i started using , uh , doxycycline only one a day because i think the pharmacist said if it's getting better , to just limit it to once a day .\n[doctor] okay , that sounds good .\n[patient] but i was taking it twice a day and i did notice a lotta improvement .\n[doctor] okay .\n[patient] and then when i started doing it only once a day , it seems the same and it's not continuing to get better . so it's kinda plateaued a little bit .\n[doctor] i see . um , are you breastfeeding at this time ?\n[patient] no , i'm not right now .\n[doctor] okay , good . so you- you should not be breastfeeding while you're on that medication .\n[patient] yeah , actually i stopped breastfeeding and then asked for the doxycycline at that time .\n[doctor] okay . even with the doxycycline , you can keep using the elidel .\n[patient] okay . and i did n't take the elidel because when i read about it i got worried . so i wanted to just try the doxycycline and see .\n[doctor] okay . so we can talk about the elidel . a lot of the things you read about is not actually relevant to the cream or ointment form , but it's about the oral form that's used in really high doses , longterm , after people have a heart transplant or a kidney transplant or something like that .\n[patient] okay . i did n't realize that .\n[doctor] yeah , and when you suppress the immune system that hard for that long , it can predispose you for developing cancers like hematologic type cancers . it does n't apply to as-needed use of the medicine , a cream or an ointment , okay ?\n[patient] okay . then i can resume taking - taking the doxycycline twice a day again ?\n[doctor] so let me clarify . what exactly are you using ? and then we'll look at you and figure out , okay ? so you're using the sulfacetamide wash ? uh , how frequently are you using that one ?\n[patient] twice a day .\n[doctor] okay , and that's not drying you out too much ?\n[patient] no , that's fine .\n[doctor] okay . and you're using the metro cream ?\n[patient] yes .\n[doctor] how often are you using that one ?\n[patient] after my face wash , i immediately apply the cream .\n[doctor] okay . and then , are you using any other kind of lotions or anything ?\n[patient] no .\n[doctor] so you're not using the cetaphil cleanser ?\n[patient] i'm not .\n[doctor] okay . and no neutrogena wipes ?\n[patient] no wipes .\n[doctor] okay . um , and then what about , um , any lotions that you're using ?\n[patient] i'm not using any lotion right now , just those two .\n[doctor] no lotion , okay . so that may be something else we should add in , a lotion to just help moisturize . but we'll see .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] um , and then again , when did you go down to just taking the doxycycline once a day ?\n[patient] that was last week . so the first two weeks , i did twice a day .\n[doctor] okay .\n[patient] and then i started seeing improvement , and then i changed to just once a day .\n[doctor] okay . let me take a look at your face here . i'm gon na describe for the transcriptionist what i'm seeing . you're fitzpatrick skin type iv , meaning you're not going to burn , you're going to sun tan , um , essentially , iv to v. and then on bilateral medial cheeks , there are a few really faint erythematous papules and just maybe a little bit of redness around and underneath your nostrils . so you're right , it's not totally gone .\n[patient] yeah .\n[doctor] i think i would go ahead and go back to twice a day , every day , with the doxycycline .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] uh , but i would pickup the elidel too .\n[patient] okay , i can do that .\n[doctor] i mean , out of known risks associated with medications , topicals are usually safer and preferable to oral medications . with that being said , doxycycline is low risk .\n[patient] it is ? okay .\n[doctor] um , and doxycycline can give you bad upset stomach or heartburn . um , it will make you sunburn , even if you never sunburn , so you have to protect yourself .\n[patient] yeah , i mean , i feel sun sensitive whenever i go out , so i am taking all the precautions , with wearing a hat and all of that .\n[doctor] great . i just wanted to make sure you knew about that .\n[patient] yes , i did . thank you .\n[doctor] all right . but i think to help get rid of it sooner rather than later , if insurance will cover the elidel , pick it up and start using it .\n[patient] yeah , i did check . the insurance is not covering it .\n[doctor] it's not ? okay . well , let's look around really quick because if you use a goodrx coupon , it will be around 30 to $ 40 or something .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] let's see .\n[patient] so with your coupon , it was around $ 850 or something .\n[doctor] ugh , yeah . that's way too much .\n[patient] i agree . and- and because i also looked at the eucrisa that you recommended in my notes , and if it's still ex- if it's still expensive , i could try that instead .\n[doctor] yeah , so it ... actually ... it is actually more expensive . i think the prices fluctuate .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] because now it's showing the cheapest of $ 70 , and when i looked before , it was around 30 to $ 40 .\n[patient] yeah . if it was around $ 200 , i would've picked it up . but it was coming to around $ 850 after insurance .\n[doctor] okay . so i've found the cream form . we could try ointment form .\n[patient] you mean the tacrolimus ?\n[doctor] yeah , mm-hmm .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] so if we send it to pick'n save or metro market ... let's see where else .\n[patient] can you do the metro market ?\n[doctor] yeah . let me put in the prescription and we'll see what we can find .\n[patient] sure .\n[doctor] pharmacy is what i'm trying to say .\n[patient] okay . but it's not a steroid , right ?\n[doctor] correct , it's not a steroid .\n[patient] okay , good .\n[doctor] it's called a calcineurin inhibitor . it's kinda like a steroid in that it calms inflammation .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] but it's not a steroid , so do n't use steroids on your face , for sure , as they'll make this kind of rash worse . but also , steroids carry the risk of causing thinning of the skin .\n[patient] all right .\n[doctor] these medications do n't cause thinning of the skin and they're not going to cause some other kind of rash . um , the thing to know is that sometimes five to 10 minutes after you put it on , it can cause this weird kind of tingly or needle-like sensation or make it redder or flush . but it should only last a few seconds and then go away . it's not an allergy or anything bad .\n[patient] okay . got it .\n[doctor] so it only lasts a couple seconds . it does n't mean it's going to happen again . it's nothing bad . it will still work , so keep using it as long as you know you can stand it , okay ?\n[patient] okay , thank you for explaining .\n[doctor] so i will say , \" apply to rash on face twice daily , until resolved . \"\n[patient] okay . so only apply to the rash area ?\n[doctor] yes , and keep using the face wash.\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] i think you could just do it once a day . i do n't think you need to do it twice a day , just because i do n't wan na dry your sky out too much , okay ?\n[patient] i never noticed that my face is dry or got thin . i feel so good after using it .\n[doctor] i understand , but it could get dry and i do n't wan na create other problems for you .\n[patient] all right . i'll just wash once a day with it . but it was feeling very good , like there's this little bit of moisture getting back in . with the other wash , when i would use it twice a day , i was drying out . but not with this one .\n[doctor] i see . okay . well then do what feels good . if you do notice that you're starting to get dry , then reduce to once per day .\n[patient] that sounds good .\n[doctor] so to review , um , continue using the same face wash , continue with metro cream , and increase the use of doxycycline to twice a day .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] and then just do it until it's gone , and then do it for once a day for another week before stopping .\n[patient] okay , sounds good .\n[doctor] all right . and i'll rewrite your instructions here .\n[patient] thank you so much .\n[doctor] if there are any other questions or you're getting different instructions , feel free to reach out to me and we'll clarify , okay ?\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] but in general , doxycycline is such a low risk . we're not gon na have you on this forever . but especially since we're adding the tacrolimus , i expect it will clear quickly .\n[patient] sounds good .\n[doctor] all right . and i just wan na really help knock it out as fast as possible , since you've been dealing with it for so long now . i would take it twice a day until it's gone , and then once a day for a week before you stop . i'll write it out like that . so twice a day until rash is gone , and then once a day for another week before stopping .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] once the rash stops , you can stop the tacrolimus ointment . um , continue doxycycline another week and then stop . but you can keep using the wash and the metro cream .\n[patient] okay , that sounds good . i can do that .\n[doctor] and then hold off until i see you again before you start back any of your old products . um , if it's starting to flair again , um , if it's just a little bit , you can try just doing the tacrolimus for a couple days , to see if that's enough . if it's not , then restart the dy- doxycycline as well .\n[patient] all right .\n[doctor] i do n't expect that to happen , but , you know , if it does , you have the tools . um , then you'll be seeing me for a followup . we can figure out what to do next . i would say if it's getting worse rather than better , just give me a call or send me a mychart message , okay ?\n[patient] yeah , sounds good .\n[doctor] do you have enough refills ?\n[patient] yeah , i think so .\n[doctor] okay . so it looks like you have another refill of the doxycycline , so you're good there . metro cream , you probably still have enough of that one .\n[patient] yes , i do .\n[doctor] all right . and i'll cancel the elidel cream , just so we do n't complicate your list . uh , you have plenty of the face wash still .\n[patient] yes .\n[doctor] okay . uh , and we'll get rid of the clindamycin from your list as well .\n[patient] and what would you suggest for a moisturizer ?\n[doctor] yeah , so for that i would do something really basic like vanicream . or even , if it's just really dry , you could use a little bit of petroleum jelly . um , i'll give you a couple samples , okay ? let's make sure we have a followup in about four weeks .\n[patient] okay , thank you .\n[doctor] okay . and i would stay away from any kind of anti-aging thing , any kind of plant thing . um , really let's just be sure we talk about any new products , or reach out to me if you're gon na try something else . um , let's go get those samples .\n[patient] okay , that sounds good .\n[doctor] for assessment and plan , perioral dermatitis , rosacea , including ocular rosacea , and copy and paste her patient instructions . i recommend that she gently wash her eyelids once a day with gentle cleanser such as vanicream , also use bruder mask as needed .\n</conversation>\nThe generated note will be provided in these tags:\n<response>\n**HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS**\n\nJacqueline Miller, a  patient with a history of perioral dermatitis and rosacea, including ocular rosacea, presented for follow-up. She reported that her condition had improved significantly after starting doxycycline, but had plateaued when she reduced the dosage to once a day. She had been using the sulfacetamide wash twice a day and the metro cream after washing her face. She had stopped breastfeeding and was not currently taking any other medications. She had concerns about the elidel cream due to misinformation she had read, but the doctor explained that the oral form of the medication has different risks compared to the topical form.\n\n**PHYSICAL EXAM**\n\nThe patient's Fitzpatrick skin type is IV-V, indicating a moderate skin type that tans easily. Examination revealed faint erythematous papules on the bilateral medial cheeks and redness around and underneath the nostrils. The doctor noted that the rash was not completely gone.\n\n**RESULTS**\n\nThe patient's condition had improved significantly after starting doxycycline, but had plateaued when the dosage was reduced to once a day. The doctor recommended increasing the dosage to twice a day and adding the tacrolimus ointment to help clear the rash more quickly.\n\n**ASSESSMENT AND PLAN**\n\nDiagnosis: Perioral dermatitis and rosacea, including ocular rosacea.\n\nPlan:\n\n* Continue using the sulfacetamide wash once a day.\n* Apply the metro cream to the rash area twice a day until the rash is gone, then once a day for another week before stopping.\n* Increase the dosage of doxycycline to twice a day.\n* Add the tacrolimus ointment to the treatment plan, applying it to the rash area twice a day until the rash is gone, then once a day for another week before stopping.\n* Continue using the doxycycline for another week after the rash is gone.\n* Use a gentle cleanser, such as vanicream, to wash the eyelids once a day.\n* Use a Bruder mask as needed.\n* Avoid using any anti-aging or plant-based products.\n* Follow-up appointment in four weeks.\n* If the rash flares up, try using the tacrolimus ointment for a few days to see if it resolves, and restart the doxycycline if necessary.\n</response>\nThe reference note will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nCHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nFollow-up for perioral dermatitis.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nJacqueline Miller is a 40-year-old female who is being seen today for a follow-up skin exam for perioral dermatitis. She also has a history of rosacea, including ocular rosacea. Today, she states that her perioral dermatitis is well-controlled, although it has not fully resolved. The patient was applying doxycycline twice a day with improvement, but her pharmacist advised her to reduce to once daily since it had started to improve; therefore, for approximately the past week, she has been using the doxycycline only once per day. She has not seen continued improvement but it has not worsened. She is using the sulfacetamide wash twice daily, denies drying of the skin, and reports that her skin is much improved moisturization. She also applies MetroCream immediately after using the sulfacetamide wash. She denies using other lotions and products, Cetaphil lotion or soap, or Neutrogena wipes. The patient did not begin Elidel because it is not covered by her insurance, and she was concerned about possible side effects from the medication.\n\nPAST HISTORY\n\nMedical\nPerioral dermatitis.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS\n\nDoxycycline cream. Apply twice daily.\nMetroCream. \nSulfacetamide wash. Apply topically twice daily.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nIntegumentary\nSkin inspection of the face was performed today. On bilateral medial cheeks, there are a few, very faint, erythematous papules with mild redness around and underneath the nostrils. Fitzpatrick skin type is 4 to 5.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\n\u2022 Perioral dermatitis\n\u2022 Rosacea, including ocular rosacea\n\nJacqueline Miller is a 40-year-old female who presented today for follow-up for her perioral dermatitis, which has improved but not resolved. She decreased her doxycycline per her pharmacist\u2019s recommendation, which possibly stagnated the resolution of symptoms.\n\nPLAN\n\nPerioral dermatitis.\nI counseled the patient about the risks and benefits of doxycycline and recommended she resume twice daily application until she reaches full resolution, and at that point she should reduce application to once a day for an additional week. The patient will not be using Elidel as I reviewed the cost of the medication and without insurance, it was too expensive. I provided a prescription for Tacrolimus and counseled her on possible side effects of using the medication. She will continue with Sulfacetamide face wash once a day. Also, use Bruder mask as needed.\n\nRosacea, including ocular rosacea.\nContinue using MetroCream twice daily. I recommended to gently wash her eyelids once daily with a gentle cleanser and try a gentle cream such as Vanicream.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nCall the clinic if symptoms worsen. The patient will have a follow-up appointment in 4 weeks.\n</gold_response>\nCarefully review the <response> based on the <conversation> and compare it to the <gold_response> when needed.\n\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Does the note provide correct clinical information based on the conversation?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the note include all important medical details from the conversation?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the note written clearly and organized in a standard clinical format for clinicians\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n"

              "text": "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nWayne Jenkins is a pleasant 43-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of a right foot wound, onset 2 to 3 weeks ago. He was seen by his primary care physician who referred him to our office. His last visit with a podiatrist was 2 years ago, however they moved, and he has been unable to get another podiatrist. He denies any specific injury.\n\nThe patient purchased a new pair of shoes and was breaking them in prior to traveling. Initially, he did not feel that the shoes were too tight, however a blister formed on his right foot. The patient does have neuropathy and notes this might be why he did not notice the tightness. His blister soon became a wound and he was seen by his PCP. He was placed on a round of antibiotics, which he completed yesterday. He denies any changes to the appearance of the wound. The patient denies pain or drainage. His sock will occasionally stick to his wound, regardless of if he has a Band-Aid covering it. The patient has discontinued the use of these shoes. Occasionally, he has issues with stability, which was a primary purpose of purchasing these shoes. He denies any fever or chills.\n\nRegarding his diabetes, his last hemoglobin A1C was 8.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nConstitutional: Denies fever and chills.\nSkin: Reports right foot wound.\nNeurological: Reports neuropathy.\n\nVITALS\n\nTemperature: 98.1.\nHeart rate: 72.\nRespiration: 16.\nBlood pressure: 110/65 mm Hg.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nCV: Palpable bilateral femoral and popliteal pulses. No palpable DP or PT pulses but Doppler signs are present. No evidence of fluid collection.\nSKIN: On the right foot, there is a 1 x 2 inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot that is just proximal to the 5th MTP joint. There is some yellow slough present with minimal granulation tissue. No surrounding erythema or cellulitis. No necrosis. No odor.\n\nRESULTS\n\n3 views of the right foot were taken today. These reveal no evidence of osteomyelitis.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\n1. Right foot diabetic ulcer.\n2. Diabetes.\n\nPLAN\n\nAfter reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient regarding his current symptoms. I have explained to him that his x-rays did not reveal any evidence of osteomyelitis. At this time, I have recommended that we obtain an ankle brachial index ABI to determine the blood supply to his foot to see if he can heal this wound. I have also performed a debridement in the office to remove some of the dead tissue. I have prescribed a collagenase ointment to be applied to the wound 1 time daily and instructed him to cover with a dry sterile dressing. He will continue this until we see the wound shrinking and the nice pink tissue is present. I have also recommended that the patient be placed in a surgical shoe to take pressure off the area. I do not think that antibiotics are needed at this time. He may need to see a vascular specialist if the ABI indicates that his blood supply is not optimal for wound healing.\n\nRegarding his diabetes, I explained the need for controlling his diabetes and the effects this will have on wound healing. I have recommended a diabetic consultation to discuss diet modifications to bring his hemoglobin A1c to a better level.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nThe patient will follow up with me in 2 weeks to check on his progress."

The wound has been present for approximately 2-3 weeks and was initially a blister caused by a new pair of shoes. He reports that the wound has not improved despite completing a course of antibiotics prescribed by his primary care physician (PCP). The patient has a history of neuropathy and has not felt the wound, which is a 1x2 inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot. He has a history of diabetes with an HbA1c of 8.1. The patient has not experienced any fever, chills, or drainage from the wound.\n\n**PHYSICAL EXAM**\n\nThe patient's vital signs are within normal limits. The physical exam reveals a 1x2 inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot with yellow slough and minimal granulation tissue. There is no surrounding erythema, cellulitis, or fluid collection. The patient has palpable bilateral femoral and popliteal pulses, but no palpable DP or PT pulses. Doppler signs are present. The wound does not hurt when touched.\n\n**RESULTS**\n\nThe patient's right foot X-ray shows no evidence of osteomyelitis. The ankle-brachial index (ABI) will be ordered to determine the blood supply to the foot. The patient's HbA1c is 8.1.\n\n**ASSESSMENT AND PLAN**\n\nThe patient has a diabetic foot ulcer that requires further management. The plan is to perform a debridement to remove dead tissue, apply collagenase ointment to the wound once daily, and cover with a dry sterile dressing. The patient will wear a surgical shoe to take pressure off the area. The patient will be seen in two weeks to assess wound healing. If the ABI indicates poor blood supply, a vascular specialist may be referred. Additionally, the patient will be referred to a diabetic specialist to discuss ways to modify his diet and improve his HbA1c levels.",

yes\n[doctor] so can you tell me about that how are you doing\n[patient] well i've been doing okay but i've had this wound on my right foot for a couple of weeks and it's not getting better i saw my pcp and they referred me to you i i used to see a podiatrist and a couple of years ago but they moved and i was n't able to get another one\n[doctor] okay and how long have you had the wound\n[patient] about two to three weeks\n[doctor] okay have you had any kind of trauma to that foot\n[patient] no i bought a new pair of shoes to travel with and the neuropathy i guess i did n't feel that they were too tight at first it was just a blister but it looked a lot worse now i've been putting a band-aid on it and\n[doctor] okay and so did your doctor put you on any antibiotics when they they saw your foot\n[patient] yes i finished the course yesterday the wound looked about the same though\n[doctor] okay now does it hurt\n[patient] no i ca n't feel it\n[doctor] okay now have you had any other symptoms like fever chills drainage from the wound or anything along those lines\n[patient] no but when i take my sock off sometimes it sticks to the wound even when i put a band-aid on\n[doctor] okay well are you still wearing those same shoes that cause the problem\n[patient] no i'm upset\n[doctor] i'm so upset too i love those shoes\n[patient] no i'm so upset i i love those shoes\n[doctor] okay so what kind of shoes are they\n[patient] they're hoka's\n[doctor] ah so where did you get them\n[patient] i got them at rei couple of years ago\n[doctor] they're pretty good about helping you to fit your fit you in a shoe are n't they\n[patient] yeah\n[doctor] so what do you like about them\n[patient] they are comfortable they are easy to take on and off and they provide good stability\n[doctor] that's good so you've had some issues with stability sometimes or\n[patient] yes\n[doctor] okay okay well another question i want to ask you is how is your diabetes doing\n[patient] i do n't think it's too bad my last hgb a1c was a little over eight\n[doctor] okay alright well let me just do a quick physical exam okay for vital signs your temperature is ninety eight . one your vital signs look good your heart rate is seventy two respirations sixteen blood pressure is one ten over sixty five okay so on your foot exam let's see there is a one by two inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot it is just proximal to the right fifth to the fifth mtp joint and there is some yellow slough present with minimal granulation tissue there's no surrounding erythema or cellulitis and there's no evidence of fluid collection there's no necrosis there is no odor i do not appreciate any bony exposure on on vascular exam there are palpable bilateral femoral and popliteal pulses there are no palpable dp or pt pulses but doppler signs are present okay so does this hurt when i touch it here\n[patient] no it's okay\n[doctor] okay alright so i've reviewed the results your right foot x-ray that we did before you i came in the room and this shows no evidence of osteomyelitis which means there is no evidence of bone infection so that's really good so let me tell you a little about my assessment and plan for you so for your first problem your diabetic foot ulcer so i want to order an ankle brachial index abi to determine the blood supply to your foot to see if you can heal this wound i'm also gon na perform a debridement here in the office to take off some of the dead tissue and then next i'm going to prescribe a collagenase ointment to be applied to the wound once daily and then cover with a dry sterile dressing now we will continue this until we see the wound shrinking and a nice pink tissue is present and i want you to wear a surgical shoe to take pressure off of the area okay so i do n't think any more antibiotics are needed at this time and i want to see you again in two weeks so we may need to refer you to a vascular specialist if the abi indicates your blood supply is not optimal for wound healing okay\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] okay so for your diabetes it's gon na be very important to get your diabetes under control in order to get the wound to heal so we might even go ahead and get a diabetic consult so that we can go over some some maybe some ways you can modify your diet without a being too much but maybe that can bring down your hemoglobin a1c into a little bit better level okay\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] alright do you have any other questions\n[patient] no\n[doctor] okay\n</conversation>\nThe generated note will be provided in these tags:\n<response>\n**HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS**\n\nThe patient, Wayne, is a  male who presents with a non-healing wound on his right foot. The wound has been present for approximately 2-3 weeks and was initially a blister caused by a new pair of shoes. He reports that the wound has not improved despite completing a course of antibiotics prescribed by his primary care physician (PCP). The patient has a history of neuropathy and has not felt the wound, which is a 1x2 inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot. He has a history of diabetes with an HbA1c of 8.1. The patient has not experienced any fever, chills, or drainage from the wound.\n\n**PHYSICAL EXAM**\n\nThe patient's vital signs are within normal limits. The physical exam reveals a 1x2 inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot with yellow slough and minimal granulation tissue. There is no surrounding erythema, cellulitis, or fluid collection. The patient has palpable bilateral femoral and popliteal pulses, but no palpable DP or PT pulses. Doppler signs are present. The wound does not hurt when touched.\n\n**RESULTS**\n\nThe patient's right foot X-ray shows no evidence of osteomyelitis. The ankle-brachial index (ABI) will be ordered to determine the blood supply to the foot. The patient's HbA1c is 8.1.\n\n**ASSESSMENT AND PLAN**\n\nThe patient has a diabetic foot ulcer that requires further management. The plan is to perform a debridement to remove dead tissue, apply collagenase ointment to the wound once daily, and cover with a dry sterile dressing. The patient will wear a surgical shoe to take pressure off the area. The patient will be seen in two weeks to assess wound healing. If the ABI indicates poor blood supply, a vascular specialist may be referred. Additionally, the patient will be referred to a diabetic specialist to discuss ways to modify his diet and improve his HbA1c levels.\n</response>\nThe reference note will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nWayne Jenkins is a pleasant 43-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of a right foot wound, onset 2 to 3 weeks ago. He was seen by his primary care physician who referred him to our office. His last visit with a podiatrist was 2 years ago, however they moved, and he has been unable to get another podiatrist. He denies any specific injury.\n\nThe patient purchased a new pair of shoes and was breaking them in prior to traveling. Initially, he did not feel that the shoes were too tight, however a blister formed on his right foot. The patient does have neuropathy and notes this might be why he did not notice the tightness. His blister soon became a wound and he was seen by his PCP. He was placed on a round of antibiotics, which he completed yesterday. He denies any changes to the appearance of the wound. The patient denies pain or drainage. His sock will occasionally stick to his wound, regardless of if he has a Band-Aid covering it. The patient has discontinued the use of these shoes. Occasionally, he has issues with stability, which was a primary purpose of purchasing these shoes. He denies any fever or chills.\n\nRegarding his diabetes, his last hemoglobin A1C was 8.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nConstitutional: Denies fever and chills.\nSkin: Reports right foot wound.\nNeurological: Reports neuropathy.\n\nVITALS\n\nTemperature: 98.1.\nHeart rate: 72.\nRespiration: 16.\nBlood pressure: 110/65 mm Hg.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nCV: Palpable bilateral femoral and popliteal pulses. No palpable DP or PT pulses but Doppler signs are present. No evidence of fluid collection.\nSKIN: On the right foot, there is a 1 x 2 inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot that is just proximal to the 5th MTP joint. There is some yellow slough present with minimal granulation tissue. No surrounding erythema or cellulitis. No necrosis. No odor.\n\nRESULTS\n\n3 views of the right foot were taken today. These reveal no evidence of osteomyelitis.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\n1. Right foot diabetic ulcer.\n2. Diabetes.\n\nPLAN\n\nAfter reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient regarding his current symptoms. I have explained to him that his x-rays did not reveal any evidence of osteomyelitis. At this time, I have recommended that we obtain an ankle brachial index ABI to determine the blood supply to his foot to see if he can heal this wound. I have also performed a debridement in the office to remove some of the dead tissue. I have prescribed a collagenase ointment to be applied to the wound 1 time daily and instructed him to cover with a dry sterile dressing. He will continue this until we see the wound shrinking and the nice pink tissue is present. I have also recommended that the patient be placed in a surgical shoe to take pressure off the area. I do not think that antibiotics are needed at this time. He may need to see a vascular specialist if the ABI indicates that his blood supply is not optimal for wound healing.\n\nRegarding his diabetes, I explained the need for controlling his diabetes and the effects this will have on wound healing. I have recommended a diabetic consultation to discuss diet modifications to bring his hemoglobin A1c to a better level.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nThe patient will follow up with me in 2 weeks to check on his progress.\n</gold_response>\nCarefully review the <response> based on the <conversation> and compare it to the <gold_response> when needed.\n\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Does the note provide correct clinical information based on the conversation?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the note include all important medical details from the conversation?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the note written clearly and organized in a standard clinical format for clinicians\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n"

While walking 6 days ago, she felt her back seize up on her. She is not sure what caused it but thinks she was walking a little faster than usual. She describes the sensation as a spasm. She has been taking ibuprofen and using heat on it but it is still pretty stiff. She denies any known trauma or injury to her back. She notes she has been weightlifting around 3 times a week. She did do deadlifts that day before her walk and thinks she may have been using her back more than her legs to lift. She locates the pain in her mid lower back. She denies any lower extremity numbness, tingling, and weakness.\n\nRegarding her hypertension, she states she has been doing readings at home and that has been looking great. She has been watching her diet which has helped. She is taking lisinopril.\n\nThe patient endorses nasal congestion, which she attributes to her seasonal allergies.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\n\u2022 Ears, Nose, Mouth and Throat: Endorses nasal congestion from seasonal allergies.\n\u2022 Musculoskeletal: Endorses bilateral low back pain and stiffness.\n\u2022 Neurological: Denies numbness.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION\n\n\u2022 Cardiovascular: Slight 2/6 systolic ejection murmur, stable.\n\u2022 Musculoskeletal: Pain to palpation along the right lateral aspect of her lumbar spine. Pain with flexion and extension. Negative straight leg raise.\n\nRESULTS\n\nBack x-ray reveals good bony alignment with no obvious fracture.\n\nLabs: All within normal limits.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN\n\nMs. Ramirez is a 34-year-old female with a past medical history significant for hypertension, who presents today with back pain.\n\nBack pain.\n\u2022 Medical Reasoning: She experienced a spasm-like pain in her back while walking approximately 6 days ago. She has also been lifting weights recently. Her lumbar spine x-ray was unremarkable and her recent labs were normal. I believe she has a lumbar strain.\n\u2022 Medical Treatment: We will initiate meloxicam 15 mg once daily.\n\u2022 Specialist Referrals: We will refer her to physical therapy to work on strengthening exercises.\n\u2022 Patient Education and Counseling: She may apply ice and heat to the area.\n\nHypertension.\n\u2022 Medical Reasoning: This is well controlled with lisinopril and dietary modifications based on home monitoring.\n\u2022 Medical Treatment: She will continue lisinopril 10 mg daily. This was refilled today.\n\u2022 Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged her to continue with home monitoring and report any elevated blood pressures to me.\n\nPatient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.\n"

She reports that the pain started after a recent increase in walking, with a duration of 30 minutes to an hour per day. She describes the pain as a sudden onset, feeling like a spasm, and has been experiencing stiffness in the lower back. She has been taking ibuprofen and applying heat to the area, but the pain persists. She has a history of hypertension and has been taking lisinopril as prescribed. She also reports lifting weights three times a week, which may have contributed to the back pain. She denies any trauma, numbness, tingling, or weakness in her lower extremities. Her blood pressure has been well-controlled, and she has been monitoring it at home.\n\n**PHYSICAL EXAM**\n\nThe patient's vital signs are within normal limits, with a well-controlled blood pressure. The physical exam reveals pain to palpation on the right lateral aspect of the lumbar spine, with pain on flexion and extension. The straight leg raise is negative. The heart exam reveals a stable 2/6 systolic ejection murmur. The lungs are clear.\n\n**RESULTS**\n\nThe patient underwent an x-ray of the lumbar spine, which shows good boney alignment and no obvious fracture. The lab results, including white blood cell count and other parameters, are within normal limits, with no signs of infection.\n\n**ASSESSMENT AND PLAN**\n\nThe patient is diagnosed with a lumbar strain, likely caused by lifting weights or exercising. The plan is to prescribe meloxicam 15mg once a day for pain management, with instructions to ice and apply heat to the area as needed. The patient is also referred to physical therapy for strengthening exercises to prevent future episodes. The patient is to continue taking lisinopril 10mg daily for hypertension management, and to monitor her blood pressure readings at home. A refill of lisinopril is ordered. The patient is to follow up with the nurse for further instructions and to have her blood pressure checked.",

She reports that the pain started after a recent increase in walking, with a duration of 30 minutes to an hour per day. She describes the pain as a sudden onset, feeling like a spasm, and has been experiencing stiffness in the lower back. She has been taking ibuprofen and applying heat to the area, but the pain persists. She has a history of hypertension and has been taking lisinopril as prescribed. She also reports lifting weights three times a week, which may have contributed to the back pain. She denies any trauma, numbness, tingling, or weakness in her lower extremities. Her blood pressure has been well-controlled, and she has been monitoring it at home.\n\n**PHYSICAL EXAM**\n\nThe patient's vital signs are within normal limits, with a well-controlled blood pressure. The physical exam reveals pain to palpation on the right lateral aspect of the lumbar spine, with pain on flexion and extension. The straight leg raise is negative. The heart exam reveals a stable 2/6 systolic ejection murmur. The lungs are clear.\n\n**RESULTS**\n\nThe patient underwent an x-ray of the lumbar spine, which shows good boney alignment and no obvious fracture. The lab results, including white blood cell count and other parameters, are within normal limits, with no signs of infection.\n\n**ASSESSMENT AND PLAN**\n\nThe patient is diagnosed with a lumbar strain, likely caused by lifting weights or exercising. The plan is to prescribe meloxicam 15mg once a day for pain management, with instructions to ice and apply heat to the area as needed. The patient is also referred to physical therapy for strengthening exercises to prevent future episodes. The patient is to continue taking lisinopril 10mg daily for hypertension management, and to monitor her blood pressure readings at home. A refill of lisinopril is ordered. The patient is to follow up with the nurse for further instructions and to have her blood pressure checked.\n</response>\nThe reference note will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nCHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nBack pain.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nMs. Ramirez is a 34-year-old female with a past medical history significant for hypertension, who presents today with back pain.\n\nThe patient reports she has been walking a lot lately, 30 minutes to an hour or so a day. While walking 6 days ago, she felt her back seize up on her. She is not sure what caused it but thinks she was walking a little faster than usual. She describes the sensation as a spasm. She has been taking ibuprofen and using heat on it but it is still pretty stiff. She denies any known trauma or injury to her back. She notes she has been weightlifting around 3 times a week. She did do deadlifts that day before her walk and thinks she may have been using her back more than her legs to lift. She locates the pain in her mid lower back. She denies any lower extremity numbness, tingling, and weakness.\n\nRegarding her hypertension, she states she has been doing readings at home and that has been looking great. She has been watching her diet which has helped. She is taking lisinopril.\n\nThe patient endorses nasal congestion, which she attributes to her seasonal allergies.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\n\u2022 Ears, Nose, Mouth and Throat: Endorses nasal congestion from seasonal allergies.\n\u2022 Musculoskeletal: Endorses bilateral low back pain and stiffness.\n\u2022 Neurological: Denies numbness.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION\n\n\u2022 Cardiovascular: Slight 2/6 systolic ejection murmur, stable.\n\u2022 Musculoskeletal: Pain to palpation along the right lateral aspect of her lumbar spine.

She has also been lifting weights recently. Her lumbar spine x-ray was unremarkable and her recent labs were normal. I believe she has a lumbar strain.\n\u2022 Medical Treatment: We will initiate meloxicam 15 mg once daily.\n\u2022 Specialist Referrals: We will refer her to physical therapy to work on strengthening exercises.\n\u2022 Patient Education and Counseling: She may apply ice and heat to the area.\n\nHypertension.\n\u2022 Medical Reasoning: This is well controlled with lisinopril and dietary modifications based on home monitoring.\n\u2022 Medical Treatment: She will continue lisinopril 10 mg daily. This was refilled today.\n\u2022 Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged her to continue with home monitoring and report any elevated blood pressures to me.\n\nPatient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.\n\n</gold_response>\nCarefully review the <response> based on the <conversation> and compare it to the <gold_response> when needed.\n\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Does the note provide correct clinical information based on the conversation?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the note include all important medical details from the conversation?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the note written clearly and organized in a standard clinical format for clinicians\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n"

            "text": "**HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS**\n\nMr. James, a 66-year-old male, presented to the office with a 5-month history of constant pain in his left shoulder and elbow. He reported that the pain began after a fall 5 months ago while going up the stairs, which resulted in him landing on his left side. The pain has been persistent and worsens with lifting, particularly with weightlifting. He has been unable to lift more than 15-20 pounds and has stopped going to the gym due to the pain. He has tried icing the area, but has not taken any pain medication. He continues to walk 30 minutes a day with his wife. He denies numbness or tingling in the affected area.\n\n**PHYSICAL EXAM**\n\nThe patient's physical exam revealed tenderness to palpation over the left shoulder and elbow, with positive Hawkins-Kennedy and Neer's test. The proximal and distal upper extremity strength was normal, and sensation was intact in the median, radial, and ulnar nerves. The patient was able to abduct his arm to 90 degrees without difficulty. The exam was otherwise unremarkable.\n\n**RESULTS**\n\nThe patient's physical exam results were consistent with impingement syndrome of the left shoulder. The patient's symptoms and history of a fall 5 months ago are consistent with this diagnosis. The patient's wrist pain is likely secondary to the shoulder impingement.\n\n**ASSESSMENT AND PLAN**\n\nAssessment: Impingement syndrome of the left shoulder.\n\nPlan: The patient will start with physical therapy, 2 sessions per week, with exercises to be done at home. If the patient's symptoms do not improve, a cortisone injection may be considered. The patient will continue to ice the affected area and rest as much as possible. A referral has been requested for Dr. Martha Rivera to initiate physical therapy. The patient will be followed up with a phone call or email if symptoms worsen or do not improve with therapy.",

He reported that the pain began after a fall 5 months ago while going up the stairs, which resulted in him landing on his left side. The pain has been persistent and worsens with lifting, particularly with weightlifting. He has been unable to lift more than 15-20 pounds and has stopped going to the gym due to the pain. He has tried icing the area, but has not taken any pain medication. He continues to walk 30 minutes a day with his wife. He denies numbness or tingling in the affected area.\n\n**PHYSICAL EXAM**\n\nThe patient's physical exam revealed tenderness to palpation over the left shoulder and elbow, with positive Hawkins-Kennedy and Neer's test. The proximal and distal upper extremity strength was normal, and sensation was intact in the median, radial, and ulnar nerves. The patient was able to abduct his arm to 90 degrees without difficulty. The exam was otherwise unremarkable.\n\n**RESULTS**\n\nThe patient's physical exam results were consistent with impingement syndrome of the left shoulder. The patient's symptoms and history of a fall 5 months ago are consistent with this diagnosis. The patient's wrist pain is likely secondary to the shoulder impingement.\n\n**ASSESSMENT AND PLAN**\n\nAssessment: Impingement syndrome of the left shoulder.\n\nPlan: The patient will start with physical therapy, 2 sessions per week, with exercises to be done at home. If the patient's symptoms do not improve, a cortisone injection may be considered. The patient will continue to ice the affected area and rest as much as possible. A referral has been requested for Dr. Martha Rivera to initiate physical therapy. The patient will be followed up with a phone call or email if symptoms worsen or do not improve with therapy.\n</response>\nThe reference note will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nCHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nLeft shoulder and elbow pain.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nMr. Jose James is a 64-year-old male who presents for left shoulder and elbow pain.\n\nThe patient reports falling on his hand while going up stairs 5 months ago and has been experiencing constant pain since. He admits he was continuing to complete strength training exercises at least 2 times per week, however, he was unable to lift more than 15-20 pounds due to the pain.\n\nDuring the past 1-2 weeks, Mr. James has discontinued strength training activities. Additionally, he has iced the inflicted areas, denies taking any pain medications, and reports his pain has slightly improved but it is still rather constant. He denies tingling and numbness.\n\nThe patient walks 30-minutes most days of the week.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nRetired last year, was an office worker.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nMusculoskeletal\nLeft shoulder and elbow, tender subacromial space. No warmth, erythema, or deformity. Positive Hawkins-Kennedy and Neer\u2019s test. Normal proximal and distal upper extremity strength. Intact median, radial, ulnar sensation. Abduction to 90 degrees. Normal empty can test.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\n\u2022 Impingement syndrome of left shoulder\n\nJose is a 64-year-old male who was seen today for impingement syndrome of his left shoulder, likely related to a fall he incurred 5 months ago.\n\nPLAN\n\nToday I discussed conservative options for left shoulder impingement with the patient, who opted to try physical therapy 2 session per week. Cortisone injection was discussed as an option if the physical therapy does not successfully reduce his pain. Additionally, I recommended continued ice and rest.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nemail, or call if symptoms worsen or do not resolve.\n\n</gold_response>\nCarefully review the <response> based on the <conversation> and compare it to the <gold_response> when needed.\n\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Does the note provide correct clinical information based on the conversation?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the note include all important medical details from the conversation?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the note written clearly and organized in a standard clinical format for clinicians\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n"

He reports a cold that started a week ago, with postnasal drip and congestion initially localized to the head, but later spreading to the upper chest. He denies fever, shortness of breath, and chest pain. He has a history of coronary artery bypass grafting, hyperlipidemia, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). He is up-to-date on COVID-19 vaccination, having received both doses.\n\n**PHYSICAL EXAM**\n\nThe patient's vital signs are within normal limits, with an oxygen saturation of 96%. Physical examination reveals cervical lymphadenopathy, bilateral ronchi, and wheezing in the lungs, consistent with a mild respiratory infection.\n\n**RESULTS**\n\n- Lipid panel: Cholesterol levels are within normal limits, with no need for changes to his current medication regimen.\n- COVID-19 test: Positive for COVID-19, with a low-level positivity.\n- Other test results not mentioned.\n\n**ASSESSMENT AND PLAN**\n\nAssessment:\n\n- COVID-19 infection, likely mild due to vaccination.\n- Respiratory infection, likely a cold.\n- Hyperlipidemia, well-controlled on current medication regimen.\n- Coronary artery disease, under control with no chest pain or shortness of breath.\n\nPlan:\n\n- Quarantine for 10 days to avoid transmission to household members.\n- Continue current medication regimen for hyperlipidemia (Crestor 20mg/day).\n- Schedule follow-up lipid panel in six months.\n- Order stress test in six months to assess coronary artery disease.\n- Provide supportive management for COVID-19 symptoms.\n- Advise patient to avoid work and contact healthcare provider if symptoms worsen.\n</response>\nThe reference note will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nCHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nUpper respiratory infection.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nLogan Harris is a 57-year-old male with a past medical history significant for coronary artery bypass grafting, hyperlipidemia, and OCD, who presents with an upper respiratory infection.\n\nThe patient reports that about a week ago he started to get a cold, which has worsened in the last 2 or 3 days.

She has a history of high blood pressure and depression, for which she has been taking medication and attending therapy sessions. She underwent a carpal tunnel release procedure two years ago, which has been successful. She reports that her depression has been well-managed with her current treatment regimen. However, she has been experiencing some stress at work, leading to an irregular diet and increased consumption of frozen meals. She has also noticed some fluctuations in her blood pressure readings over the past couple of weeks, with readings being either high or low. She denies any thoughts of self-harm and reports getting a full eight hours of sleep per night.\n\n**PHYSICAL EXAM**\n\nThe patient's physical exam was essentially normal. Her lungs were clear, and she did not have any adenopathy in her neck or signs of hyperthyroidism. Her heart was regular without any murmurs, and her grips were equal with no neurological deficits. Her pulses were normal, and her strength was good.\n\n**RESULTS**\n\nThe patient's blood pressure was elevated in the office today, with a reading of [insert reading]. Her lab results were essentially normal, with no abnormalities noted. The doctor reviewed the patient's vital signs and lab results, which showed that her blood pressure was high.\n\n**ASSESSMENT AND PLAN**\n\nThe patient was diagnosed with hypertension and depression. The doctor decided to increase the patient's lisinopril medication to 10 milligrams per day, once a day, to better manage her blood pressure. The patient will return in a month for a follow-up appointment to assess the effectiveness of the medication change. The doctor also decided to leave the patient's depression treatment regimen unchanged, as she has been doing well with her current therapy and medication. The carpal tunnel release procedure was noted to be successful, and the patient will be monitored for any signs of recurrence.",
