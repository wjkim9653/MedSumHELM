    "predicted_text": "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:\nAndrew is a 59-year-old male presenting with an upper respiratory infection characterized by fatigue, shortness of breath (particularly with exertion such as lifting or carrying heavy objects), and mild warmth suggestive of a viral illness. He reports recent outdoor activity involving yard work, which may have precipitated his symptoms. He denies cough, fever, muscle aches, joint pain (except bilateral elbow and knee discomfort likely related to physical activity), nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. He notes some joint discomfort and fatigue but otherwise feels his depression and diabetes are well-managed. No recent COVID exposure or symptoms are reported, and he has completed COVID vaccinations.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM:\nVital signs are within normal limits with no fever. Lung exam reveals scattered bilateral ronchi that clear with cough. Physical exam shows mild edema of the lower extremities and bilateral elbow tenderness on palpation. Heart sounds are normal. No other significant findings noted.\n\nRESULTS:\nChest X-ray shows no evidence of pneumonia or airspace disease. Hemoglobin A1c is elevated at 8%, indicating suboptimal glycemic control. Lipid panel is pending. Blood pressure is well-controlled on current medication. No abnormal findings on vital signs or physical exam aside from noted edema and joint tenderness.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\n1. Upper respiratory infection \u2013 likely viral; COVID test to be performed. Symptomatic treatment with Robitussin for cough, ibuprofen or acetaminophen for discomfort and mild warmth. Advise rest and hydration.\n2. Depression \u2013 currently well-managed; consider psychotherapy referral if symptoms worsen, but no immediate change.\n3. Type 2 diabetes \u2013 increase metformin to 1000 mg twice daily; follow-up with hemoglobin A1c in 4 months.\n4. Hypertension \u2013 continue lisinopril 20 mg daily; monitor blood pressure at home. Refill prescribed medication.\nAdditional orders include a COVID test, hemoglobin A1c, and lipid panel. Follow-up scheduled in approximately four months or sooner if symptoms worsen.",

He presents today with an upper respiratory infection.\n\nThe patient reports that he has been doing a bit of work out in the yard in the last week or so. He started to feel really tired and short of breath. The patient denies coughing up anything, but he feels like he will soon be coughing up phlegm. He denies having a fever, but he felt a little warm. He attributed this to exerting himself. He reports that his elbows hurt quite a bit. He notes his knees were pretty tired and he felt some tension around his knees. The patient attributes these symptoms to lifting heavy bags. He has not been wearing a mask as much recently. He believes that he caught his first cold and his symptoms have worsened. He has had both of his COVID vaccinations.\n\nHe denies any history of seasonal allergies.\n\nRegarding his depression, he states it has been a crazy year and a half. He was a little concerned about that, but for the most part, he has been doing well with it. His wife got him into barre classes and this has been relaxing.\n\nRegarding his diabetes, he has been monitoring his sugar levels while he is at work, but is not as consistent on Saturdays and Sundays. His diet has been pretty good for the most part, except for some house parties. They have not been elevated since his respiratory symptoms began.\n\nThe patient has been monitoring his blood pressure at home. He reports that he is very regular with monitoring his blood pressure during the week, though less consistently on weekends. He reports his blood pressure has been under control. He has continued to utilize lisinopril 20 mg, daily.\n\nThe patient denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\n\u2022 Constitutional: Denies fever.\n\u2022 Cardiovascular: Endorses dyspnea on exertion.\n\u2022 Respiratory: Endorses shortness of breath and cough.\n\u2022 Gastrointestinal: Denies nausea or diarrhea.\n\u2022 Musculoskeletal: Endorses bilateral elbow and knee pain.\n\u2022 Psychiatric: Endorses depression.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION\n\n\u2022 Respiratory: Scattered rhonchi bilaterally, clears with cough.\n\u2022 Cardiovascular: No murmurs, gallops, or rubs. No extra heart sounds.\n\u2022 Musculoskeletal: Edema in the bilateral lower extremities. Pain to palpation of the bilateral elbows.\n\nRESULTS\n\nX-ray of the chest is unremarkable. No airspace disease. No signs of pneumonia.\n\nHemoglobin A1c is elevated at 8.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN\n\nAndrew Campbell is a 59-year-old male with a past medical history significant for depression, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension. He presents today with an upper respiratory infection.\n\nUpper respiratory infection.\n\u2022 Medical Reasoning: I believe he has contracted a viral syndrome. His chest x-ray was unremarkable and he has received both doses of the COVID-19 vaccination.\n\u2022 Additional Testing: We will obtain a COVID-19 test to rule this out.\n\u2022 Medical Treatment: I recommend he use Robitussin for cough, as well as ibuprofen or Tylenol if he develops a fever.\n\nDepression.\n\u2022 Medical Reasoning: He has been practicing barre classes and is doing well overall.\n\u2022 Medical Treatment: I offered medication or psychotherapy, but the patient opted to defer at this time.\n\nDiabetes type 2.\n\u2022 Medical Reasoning: His blood glucose levels have been well controlled based on home monitoring, but his recent hemoglobin A1c was elevated.\n\u2022 Additional Testing: We will repeat a hemoglobin A1c in 4 months.\n\u2022 Medical Treatment: We will increase his metformin to 1000 mg twice daily.\n\nHypertension.\n\u2022 Medical Reasoning: He has been compliant with lisinopril and his blood pressures have been well controlled based on home monitoring.\n\u2022 Additional Testing: We will order a lipid panel.\n\u2022 Medical Treatment: He will continue on lisinopril 20 mg once daily. This was refilled today.\n\nFollow up: I would like to see him back in approximately 4 months.\n\nPatient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.\n</gold_response>\nCarefully review the <response> based on the <conversation> and compare it to the <gold_response> when needed.\n\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Does the note provide correct clinical information based on the conversation?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the note include all important medical details from the conversation?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the note written clearly and organized in a standard clinical format for clinicians\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\n- Rheumatoid arthritis: Continue methotrexate 2.5 mg weekly; consider rheumatology referral if needed.\n- Atrial fibrillation: Continue monitoring; refer to cardiology for possible cardiac ablation to maintain sinus rhythm.\n- Reflux: Continue Protonix 40 mg daily; maintain dietary modifications (avoid soda, spicy foods); no recent flare-ups.\n- Right elbow pain: Addressed with physical exam; consider further evaluation if symptoms persist.\nFollow-up: Patient to follow up with cardiology for AFib management and rheumatology if symptoms change. No additional questions from the patient.\n</response>\nThe reference note will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nCHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nAnnual exam.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nAndrea Roberts is a 52-year-old female with a past medical history significant for rheumatoid arthritis, atrial fibrillation, and reflux, who presents today for her annual exam. It has been a year since she was last seen.\n\nThe patient states she is doing well. She has been walking, exercising, and doing yoga, which has helped with her arthritis. She denies issues with stiffness, pain, or flare ups over the last year. The patient has continued utilizing methotrexate 2.5 mg once a week and denies issues with that.\n\nIn terms of her atrial fibrillation, she endorses continued palpitations. The last episode she had was about 1 week ago. She has noticed that when she starts to get stressed they start to flare up again. She has tried meditation and running with her dog for stress relief, however these have not been helpful. The patient had called last month and had an event monitor done.\n\nRegarding her GERD, she has continued to utilize Protonix 40 mg a day. The patient has cut out soda, which seemed to help. She has not had a flare up in over 5 months.\n\nThe patient endorses nasal congestion because of her allergies. She denies chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, and vomitting.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\n\u2022 Ears, Nose, Mouth and Throat: Endorses nasal congestion from allergies.\n\u2022 Cardiovascular: Denies chest pain or dyspnea. Endorses palpitations.\n\u2022 Respiratory: Denies shortness of breath.\n\u2022 Musculoskeletal: Denies joint pain.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION\n\n\u2022 Respiratory: Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.\n\u2022 Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm. Slight 2/6 systolic ejection murmur.\n\u2022 Musculoskeletal: No lower extremity edema. Edema and erythema of the right elbow. Pain to palpation of the right elbow.\n\nRESULTS\n\nEvent monitor: Positive for conversion pause.\n\nAutoimmune panel: Normal. Well controlled rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN\n\nAndrea Roberts is a 52-year-old female with a past medical history significant for rheumatoid arthritis, atrial fibrillation, and reflux, who presents today for her annual exam. It has been a year since she was last seen.\n\nRheumatoid arthritis.\n\u2022 Medical Reasoning: The patient has remained active and has been compliant with methotrexate once weekly. Her recent autoimmune panel was normal.\n\u2022 Medical Treatment: She will continue on methotrexate 2.5 mg once weekly. This was refilled today.\n\u2022 Specialist Referrals: If she needs a referral back to the rheumatologist, she will let me know.\n\nAtrial fibrillation.\n\u2022 Medical Reasoning: She continues to experience episodes of palpitations. Her most recent episode was about 1 week ago. She is in normal sinus rhythm today, but her recent cardiac event monitor demonstrated a conversion pause.\n\u2022 Specialist Referrals: We will refer her to cardiology for a cardiac ablation.\n\nGERD.\n\u2022 Medical Reasoning: She has been compliant with dietary modifications and denies any episodes in approximately 5 months.\n\u2022 Medical Treatment: Continue on Protonix 40 mg daily.\n\u2022 Patient Education and Counseling: She could continue with dietary modifications and avoid known dietary triggers.\n\nPatient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.\n\n</gold_response>\nCarefully review the <response> based on the <conversation> and compare it to the <gold_response> when needed.\n\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Does the note provide correct clinical information based on the conversation?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the note include all important medical details from the conversation?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the note written clearly and organized in a standard clinical format for clinicians\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

His wife was concerned that his levels were elevated and wanted to take him to the emergency room. He was not admitted to the hospital. He reports that his mother is in the hospital and he has been eating poorly. He was not monitoring his blood sugars and what he was eating. When they got home from the visit he felt a lot better. Since then, he has been following his diet pretty closely. He continues Lantus insulin at bedtime.\n\nRegarding his kidney transplant and has been doing pretty well. The patient has been pretty diligent about taking immunotherapy medication and following orders. The last time he saw Dr. Reyes was about 3 weeks ago and everything seemed to be fine.\n\nRegarding his depression, the patient states it has been about a year and a half, but he has been pretty good with that. He has his moments, but as long as he finds some time to relax in the afternoon and then it seems to work out. He thinks he would probably want to continue that at least for a couple more months and see how it goes.

He reports a stressful summer due to extensive travel and adjustment to fall routines, resulting in sleep difficulties. He has tried melatonin, meditation, and stretching without relief. He denies chest pain, shortness of breath, or other systemic issues. His osteoporosis and multiple sclerosis (MS) are stable, with no recent fractures or neurological worsening. He reports some lingering right knee weakness post-surgery but otherwise feels strong.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM:\nVital signs are within normal limits. Physical exam reveals clear lungs, normal heart sounds, and some weakness in lower extremities (right 4/5, left 3/5). Reflexes are intact. The right knee shows arthritic changes on exam and radiograph, with no signs of acute injury.\n\nRESULTS:\nRight knee X-ray demonstrates degenerative changes consistent with arthritis. No other abnormal findings noted.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\n1. Osteoporosis: Continue Fosamax (alendronate) 70 mg weekly; prescription refilled.  \n2. Multiple Sclerosis: Continue current neurologist follow-up and medications; no issues reported.  \n3. Insomnia: No current effective strategies; consider further evaluation if symptoms persist.  \n4. Musculoskeletal: Arthritic changes in the right knee; no acute intervention needed.  \nFollow-up as needed; patient advised to contact the clinic with any new or worsening symptoms.\n</response>\nThe reference note will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nCHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nAnnual exam.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nJerry Nguyen a 54-year-old male with a past medical history significant for osteoporosis, and multiple sclerosis, who presents for an annual exam.\n\nThe patient states he has been traveling all over the country. He notes it has been a stressful summer and adjusting to everything in the fall.\n\nThe patient reports a lack of sleep. He has tried melatonin, meditation, and stretching every morning, but nothing has helped.\n\nFor treatment of his osteoporosis, he is on Fosamax. He denies any issues with his joints. He denies any recent broken bones.\n\nRegarding his multiple sclerosis, he last saw the neurologist 6 months ago. He is taking his medication and denies any issues with this. Previously, he experienced right leg weakness, however, this has resolved.\n\nHe does have some lingering issues with his right knee after previous surgery, but nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nThe patient denies any chest pain or shortness of breath.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\n\u2022 Cardiovascular: Denies chest pain or dyspnea.\n\u2022 Respiratory: Denies shortness of breath.\n\u2022 Musculoskeletal: Endorses right knee discomfort.\n\u2022 Neurological: Endorses insomnia.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION\n\n\u2022 Respiratory: Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.\n\u2022 Musculoskeletal: Weakness in the lower extremities, 4/5 on the right and 3/5 on the left. Reflexes are good. Arthritic changes in the right knee.\n\nRESULTS\n\nX-ray of the right knee demonstrates some arthritic changes.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nJerry Nguyen a 54-year-old male with a past medical history significant for osteoporosis, and multiple sclerosis, who presents for an annual exam.\n\nPLAN\n\nOsteoporosis.\n\u2022 Medical Reasoning: The patient is doing well with Fosamax.\n\u2022 Medical Treatment: Continue Fosamax 1 tab per week. Eleven refills were ordered today.\n\nMultiple Sclerosis.\n\u2022 Medical Reasoning: The patient is experiencing weakness of the bilateral lower extremities. He has been seeing his neurologist on a consistent basis and has been compliant with medication.\n\u2022 Medical Treatment: He will continue to follow up with his neurologist and comply with his medication regimen.\n\nRight knee arthritis.\n\u2022 Medical Reasoning: The patient recently underwent knee surgery.

    "predicted_text": "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:\nLawrence, a 62-year-old male with a history of type I diabetes, congestive heart failure (CHF), depression, and reflux, presents with a 10-day history of shortness of breath, swelling in the legs, and feelings of lethargy. He reports experiencing shortness of breath with walking up stairs and some discomfort when waking up in the morning, including stiffness and difficulty adjusting to walking. He also mentions a single episode of acute nocturnal shortness of breath about a week ago. He attributes some symptoms to dietary salt intake from recent social events. He denies chest pain, fever, chills, cough, or abdominal pain. His blood sugars have been stable, though he admits to occasional lapses in monitoring during busy weekends. He reports ongoing depression managed with non-medication strategies and has not experienced thoughts of self-harm. Reflux symptoms are being managed with omeprazole, and he has made lifestyle modifications to reduce caffeine and alcohol intake.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM:\nVital signs are within normal limits with good oxygen saturation. Physical exam reveals no jugular venous distension or carotid bruits. Cardiac exam shows a slight systolic ejection murmur (3/6). Lung exam reveals bilateral crackles at the bases. Lower extremity exam shows 1+ pitting edema. No other abnormalities noted.\n\nRESULTS:\nChest X-ray shows no evidence of airspace disease or pneumonia but does not exclude fluid retention. Laboratory results are unremarkable, with no elevated white blood cell count, indicating no infection.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\nThe patient is experiencing an acute exacerbation of congestive heart failure, likely related to dietary indiscretion. Initiate diuretic therapy with Lasix 40 mg daily and advise daily weight monitoring. Instruct to contact the provider if weight increases, symptoms worsen, or if shortness of breath occurs at rest, with instructions to seek emergency care if necessary. For diabetes management, order hemoglobin A1c in one month and ensure follow-up with endocrinology; confirm recent eye exam. Address depression by referring to psychiatry for talk therapy, with no current medication adjustments. Continue omeprazole 20 mg daily for reflux and advise lifestyle modifications. Educate the patient to call if breathing worsens or if new symptoms develop.",

finalize the notes ...\n</conversation>\nThe generated note will be provided in these tags:\n<response>\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:\nLawrence, a 62-year-old male with a history of type I diabetes, congestive heart failure (CHF), depression, and reflux, presents with a 10-day history of shortness of breath, swelling in the legs, and feelings of lethargy. He reports experiencing shortness of breath with walking up stairs and some discomfort when waking up in the morning, including stiffness and difficulty adjusting to walking. He also mentions a single episode of acute nocturnal shortness of breath about a week ago. He attributes some symptoms to dietary salt intake from recent social events. He denies chest pain, fever, chills, cough, or abdominal pain. His blood sugars have been stable, though he admits to occasional lapses in monitoring during busy weekends. He reports ongoing depression managed with non-medication strategies and has not experienced thoughts of self-harm. Reflux symptoms are being managed with omeprazole, and he has made lifestyle modifications to reduce caffeine and alcohol intake.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM:\nVital signs are within normal limits with good oxygen saturation. Physical exam reveals no jugular venous distension or carotid bruits. Cardiac exam shows a slight systolic ejection murmur (3/6). Lung exam reveals bilateral crackles at the bases. Lower extremity exam shows 1+ pitting edema. No other abnormalities noted.\n\nRESULTS:\nChest X-ray shows no evidence of airspace disease or pneumonia but does not exclude fluid retention. Laboratory results are unremarkable, with no elevated white blood cell count, indicating no infection.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\nThe patient is experiencing an acute exacerbation of congestive heart failure, likely related to dietary indiscretion. Initiate diuretic therapy with Lasix 40 mg daily and advise daily weight monitoring. Instruct to contact the provider if weight increases, symptoms worsen, or if shortness of breath occurs at rest, with instructions to seek emergency care if necessary. For diabetes management, order hemoglobin A1c in one month and ensure follow-up with endocrinology; confirm recent eye exam. Address depression by referring to psychiatry for talk therapy, with no current medication adjustments. Continue omeprazole 20 mg daily for reflux and advise lifestyle modifications. Educate the patient to call if breathing worsens or if new symptoms develop.\n</response>\nThe reference note will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nCHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nShortness of breath.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nLawrence Walker is a 62-year-old male with a past medical history significant for type 1 diabetes, congestive heart failure, depression, and reflux, who presents with complaints of shortness of breath.\n\nThe patient states he has had some shortness of breath and mild leg swelling which he thinks has to do with eating some salty foods at some house parties recently. His shortness of breath is primarily with exertion such as walking up the stairs. This has been going on for about 10 days now. He woke from sleep once with shortness of breath about a week ago. He also notes discomfort lying flat in bed and musculoskeletal stiffness in the morning. He states that it takes him a little while to get up.\n\nRegarding his type 1 diabetes, he is using his insulin pump. He has been consistently monitoring his blood sugars during the working week, but notes that he checks less on the weekends, due to being busy. He is trying to avoid sugar but admits to an affinity for chocolate bars.\n\nRegarding his depression, he states that it has been a crazy year and a half. He has tried some natural solutions. In the summer, he did daily outdoor stretching, which was great; but now that the weather has changed, he needs to find some alternatives. He is not ready to try any medications. He denies suicidal and homicidal ideation.\n\nRegarding his GERD, he is taking his omeprazole. He has made some lifestyle modifications like cutting back on his red bull intake and other caffeine. Reducing his alcohol intake has been tough during the holiday season, but he is getting better about this.\n\nThe patient denies chest pain, fever, chills, cough, and abdominal pain.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\n\u2022 Constitutional: Denies fevers, chills.\u00a0 Endorses fatigue.\n\u2022 Cardiovascular: Denies chest pain. Endorses dyspnea on exertion.\n\u2022 Respiratory: Denies coughor wheezing. Endorses shortness of breath..\n\u2022 Musculoskeletal: Endorses lower extremity edema.\n\u2022 Psychiatric: Endorses depression.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION\n\n\u2022 Neck: No carotid bruits appreciable. No jugular venous distention.\n\u2022 Respiratory: Rales are heard bilaterally at lung bases.\n\u2022 Cardiovascular: 3/6 systolic ejection murmur.\n\u2022 Musculoskeletal: 1+ pitting bilateral lower extremity edema.\n\nRESULTS\n\nChest x-ray did not show any evidence of airspace disease.\n\nLabs were all within normal limits, including the WBC.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nLawrence Walker is a 62-year-old male with a past medical history significant for type 1 diabetes, congestive heart failure, depression, and reflux, who presents with complaints of shortness of breath.\n\nPLAN\n\nAcute heart failure exacerbation.\n\u2022 Medical Reasoning: The patient is retaining fluid. He has noticed increased fluid retention following dietary indiscretion. He has experienced dyspnea on exertion for the past 10 days.\n\u2022 Medical Treatment: Initiate Lasix 40 mg a day.\n\u2022 Patient Education and Counseling: I advised the patient to monitor and log his daily weights. He will contact me if these continue to increase. He was instructed to call me or 911 if he experiences dyspnea at rest.\n\nType 1 diabetes.\n\u2022 Medical Treatment: This is currently stable with use of an insulin pump.\n\u2022 Additional Testing: I will order a hemoglobin A1c in 1 month.\n\u2022 Medical Treatment: He will continue the insulin pump. The patient will follow up with his endocrinologist.\n\u2022 Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged the patient to have an eye exam.\n\nDepression.\n\u2022 Medical Reasoning: The patient has been doing well with outdoor stretching. He continues to decline the use of medications for this issue.\n\u2022 Medical Treatment: I will refer him to psychiatry as his current management strategy is unsustainable due to the change in season.\n\u2022 Patient Education and Counseling: We will defer initiating medication at this time.\n\nAcid reflux.\n\u2022 Medical Reasoning: His symptoms are stable with medication.\n\u2022 Medical Treatment: Continue omeprazole 20 mg a day.\n\nPatient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan. his endo\n</gold_response>\nCarefully review the <response> based on the <conversation> and compare it to the <gold_response> when needed.\n\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Does the note provide correct clinical information based on the conversation?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the note include all important medical details from the conversation?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the note written clearly and organized in a standard clinical format for clinicians\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

She reports that the pain began after walking for 30 minutes to an hour, during which her back suddenly seized up, likely due to a muscle spasm. She has been taking ibuprofen and applying heat without significant relief. She has increased her weightlifting (including deadlifts) three times weekly, which may have contributed. No trauma was reported. She describes the pain as bilateral in the lower back, with no numbness, tingling, weakness, or radicular symptoms. She also reports mild nasal congestion from seasonal allergies. Her blood pressure has been well-controlled with lisinopril.\n\n**PHYSICAL EXAM:**  \nVital signs are within normal limits, with well-controlled blood pressure. Cardiac exam reveals a stable systolic ejection murmur (2/6). Back examination shows tenderness to palpation on the right lateral lumbar spine and pain with flexion and extension movements. Straight leg raise is negative. No neurological deficits are noted. Lung and heart auscultation are unremarkable.\n\n**RESULTS:**  \nLumbar spine X-ray demonstrates normal bony alignment with no fractures or abnormalities. Laboratory tests show no signs of infection or inflammation, with normal white blood cell count. The patient's blood pressure readings at home are stable.\n\n**ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:**  \nThe patient has a lumbar strain likely related to recent increased activity and weightlifting. Management includes prescribing meloxicam 15 mg once daily, with recommendations for ice and heat therapy. She is referred to physical therapy for back strengthening exercises to facilitate continued activity. Her hypertension remains well-controlled; she should continue lisinopril 10 mg daily and monitor blood pressure. She requested a refill of lisinopril, which will be provided. The patient was advised to return if symptoms worsen or if new neurological symptoms develop.",

She reports that the pain began after walking for 30 minutes to an hour, during which her back suddenly seized up, likely due to a muscle spasm. She has been taking ibuprofen and applying heat without significant relief. She has increased her weightlifting (including deadlifts) three times weekly, which may have contributed. No trauma was reported. She describes the pain as bilateral in the lower back, with no numbness, tingling, weakness, or radicular symptoms. She also reports mild nasal congestion from seasonal allergies. Her blood pressure has been well-controlled with lisinopril.\n\n**PHYSICAL EXAM:**  \nVital signs are within normal limits, with well-controlled blood pressure. Cardiac exam reveals a stable systolic ejection murmur (2/6). Back examination shows tenderness to palpation on the right lateral lumbar spine and pain with flexion and extension movements. Straight leg raise is negative. No neurological deficits are noted. Lung and heart auscultation are unremarkable.\n\n**RESULTS:**  \nLumbar spine X-ray demonstrates normal bony alignment with no fractures or abnormalities. Laboratory tests show no signs of infection or inflammation, with normal white blood cell count. The patient's blood pressure readings at home are stable.\n\n**ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:**  \nThe patient has a lumbar strain likely related to recent increased activity and weightlifting. Management includes prescribing meloxicam 15 mg once daily, with recommendations for ice and heat therapy. She is referred to physical therapy for back strengthening exercises to facilitate continued activity. Her hypertension remains well-controlled; she should continue lisinopril 10 mg daily and monitor blood pressure. She requested a refill of lisinopril, which will be provided. The patient was advised to return if symptoms worsen or if new neurological symptoms develop.\n</response>\nThe reference note will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nCHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nBack pain.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nMs. Ramirez is a 34-year-old female with a past medical history significant for hypertension, who presents today with back pain.\n\nThe patient reports she has been walking a lot lately, 30 minutes to an hour or so a day. While walking 6 days ago, she felt her back seize up on her. She is not sure what caused it but thinks she was walking a little faster than usual. She describes the sensation as a spasm. She has been taking ibuprofen and using heat on it but it is still pretty stiff. She denies any known trauma or injury to her back. She notes she has been weightlifting around 3 times a week. She did do deadlifts that day before her walk and thinks she may have been using her back more than her legs to lift. She locates the pain in her mid lower back. She denies any lower extremity numbness, tingling, and weakness.\n\nRegarding her hypertension, she states she has been doing readings at home and that has been looking great. She has been watching her diet which has helped. She is taking lisinopril.\n\nThe patient endorses nasal congestion, which she attributes to her seasonal allergies.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\n\u2022 Ears, Nose, Mouth and Throat: Endorses nasal congestion from seasonal allergies.\n\u2022 Musculoskeletal: Endorses bilateral low back pain and stiffness.\n\u2022 Neurological: Denies numbness.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION\n\n\u2022 Cardiovascular: Slight 2/6 systolic ejection murmur, stable.\n\u2022 Musculoskeletal: Pain to palpation along the right lateral aspect of her lumbar spine. Pain with flexion and extension. Negative straight leg raise.\n\nRESULTS\n\nBack x-ray reveals good bony alignment with no obvious fracture.\n\nLabs: All within normal limits.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN\n\nMs. Ramirez is a 34-year-old female with a past medical history significant for hypertension, who presents today with back pain.\n\nBack pain.\n\u2022 Medical Reasoning: She experienced a spasm-like pain in her back while walking approximately 6 days ago. She has also been lifting weights recently. Her lumbar spine x-ray was unremarkable and her recent labs were normal. I believe she has a lumbar strain.\n\u2022 Medical Treatment: We will initiate meloxicam 15 mg once daily.\n\u2022 Specialist Referrals: We will refer her to physical therapy to work on strengthening exercises.\n\u2022 Patient Education and Counseling: She may apply ice and heat to the area.\n\nHypertension.\n\u2022 Medical Reasoning: This is well controlled with lisinopril and dietary modifications based on home monitoring.\n\u2022 Medical Treatment: She will continue lisinopril 10 mg daily. This was refilled today.\n\u2022 Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged her to continue with home monitoring and report any elevated blood pressures to me.\n\nPatient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.\n\n</gold_response>\nCarefully review the <response> based on the <conversation> and compare it to the <gold_response> when needed.\n\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Does the note provide correct clinical information based on the conversation?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the note include all important medical details from the conversation?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the note written clearly and organized in a standard clinical format for clinicians\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

She reports that the pain began after participating in gymnastics class, possibly due to a fall or awkward movement. She describes the pain as constant and worsened with any movement of the shoulder. She has tried taking Tylenol for 2-3 days without relief. No prior trauma or injury was noted besides the recent activity.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM:\nOn examination, the patient exhibits tenderness and pain with active movement of the left shoulder in all directions. No visible swelling or deformity is noted. Range of motion is limited and painful. The shoulder appears normal on inspection, and there are no signs of neurovascular compromise.\n\nRESULTS:\nAn X-ray of the left shoulder shows no evidence of fracture or bony abnormalities. The findings suggest soft tissue injury rather than a fracture.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\nThe likely diagnosis is a soft tissue injury of the left shoulder, possibly involving the joint or surrounding structures. The patient is advised to continue using over-the-counter NSAIDs (ibuprofen 600 mg three times daily) for one week, along with ice or heat application as needed for pain relief. Resting the shoulder and avoiding heavy lifting or strenuous activity is recommended. The patient should follow up in 3 weeks if pain persists or worsens, at which point further evaluation or repeat imaging may be considered. She was advised to avoid carrying heavy weights and to use her right arm for activities. The patient has a history of prior left arm surgery, which is not related to current symptoms. She was instructed to contact the clinic earlier if her pain does not improve or if she experiences increased discomfort.",

It has been a year since I last saw the patient.\n\nThe patient reports that she is doing well. She has been to multiple events now that she has been able to get vaccinated for COVID-19. She reports that she has been able to see her grandchildren again and attend birthday parties.\n\nRegarding her depression, she has been going to therapy once a week for the past year. She reports that she is starting to go in person rather than virtual, which has helped even more. The patient has a good support system at home with her husband and her children live down the street.\n\nThe patient reports that her blood pressure has been doing well. She has been using the blood pressure cuff once a day and her readings seem normal. She has continued to utilize Lisinopril 20 mg daily, as prescribed.\n\nThe patient endorses nasal congestion. She denies any other symptoms of chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\n\u2022 Ears, Nose, Mouth and Throat: Endorses nasal congestion.\n\u2022 Cardiovascular: Denies chest pain or dyspnea.\n\u2022 Respiratory: Denies shortness of breath.\n\u2022 Psychiatric: Endorses depression.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION\n\n\u2022 Neck: No carotid bruits appreciable.\n\u2022 Respiratory: Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.

The fall caused him to land on his left side, injuring his shoulder and wrist. The pain has persisted since, worsening with weightlifting and activity, and has led to cessation of gym workouts. He reports that icing provides some relief but has not taken any pain medications. No numbness or tingling sensations are reported.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM:\nOn examination, tenderness was noted over the left shoulder and elbow. There was no warmth, erythema, or deformity. Special tests, including Hawkins-Kennedy and Neer's, were positive, indicating impingement. Strength in the proximal and distal upper extremities was normal, with intact sensation in median, radial, and ulnar nerve distributions. Range of motion was limited but with abduction to 90 degrees.\n\nRESULTS:\nPhysical exam findings suggest impingement syndrome of the left shoulder. No evidence of additional injury or wrist pathology was observed. The clinical presentation aligns with a rotator cuff impingement likely related to the fall.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\nDiagnosis: Impingement syndrome of the left shoulder.\nPlan:\n- Initiate physical therapy twice weekly with exercises to improve shoulder function.\n- Continue ice application and rest.\n- Referral to Dr. Martha Rivera for physical therapy.\n- Educate patient on monitoring symptoms and advise to contact the clinic if symptoms worsen or do not improve.\n- Follow-up as needed to assess progress.",

He appears irritable and has difficulty sleeping. No recent exposure to confirmed illnesses, but his older sister and a playmate with sinus infection have been in contact. He has been using saline nasal spray, humidifier, and Vicks on his feet. No current use of antibiotics.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM:\nVital signs: Temperature 100.3\u00b0F. General: Irritable but alert. ENT: Ears appear normal on exam. Nose: Congested with clear mucus. Throat: No abnormalities noted. Lungs: Clear to auscultation. Skin: Cradle cap noted, worsened since last visit. No signs of distress or severe respiratory effort.\n\nRESULTS:\nRectal temperature recorded at 100.3\u00b0F. No abnormal findings on ear exam. Cradle cap worsened; recommended treatment includes regular use of gentle dandruff shampoos (Head & Shoulders, Selsun Blue, or Nizoral AD) twice weekly and gentle brushing with baby oil. No laboratory tests performed at this visit.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\n1. Viral upper respiratory infection likely of viral etiology; no antibiotics indicated at this time. Continue supportive care with fluids, rest, and monitoring. Watch for development of a barky cough, which would suggest croup; if occurs, administer half a teaspoon of sister\u2019s medication. Prescribed a half teaspoon of medication (similar to sister\u2019s) to have on hand for potential worsening symptoms, to be used only if a barky cough develops. Advise use of Zarbee\u2019s for cough relief in infants under one year. No honey given due to age; recommend agave if needed. Follow-up in one week or sooner if symptoms worsen. \n2. Cradle cap management: Continue gentle shampooing with regular-strength dandruff shampoo twice weekly and use a soft brush with baby oil to help remove scales. Avoid eye contact during rinsing. Expect improvement over six weeks.\n3. Education provided regarding medication use, symptom monitoring, and hygiene measures. No COVID-19 concerns at this time.\n4.

that's good .\n[patient_guest] okay . okay .\n[doctor] so , there was another thing i wanted to bring up since we're here . it appears that his cradle cap has gotten a little worse . what are you using on it ?\n[patient_guest] i've been using the cradle cap brush , and then i use regular aveno shampoo .\n[doctor] is it a dandruff shampoo ?\n[patient_guest] no , i do n't think so .\n[doctor] okay , thank you . well , let's complete his exam and then we'll talk about the next steps .\n[patient_guest] okay , sounds good .\n[doctor] can you take a big breath randy .\n[patient_guest] where's mama ?\n[doctor] do n't forget to breathe little one . okay . let's try the front too .\n[patient_guest] yeah , it's okay buddy .\n[doctor] excellent . he's doing excellent . next let's- let's check out those ears .\n[patient_guest] okay .\n[doctor] let's try to make sure you do n't tip all the way over .\n[patient_guest] dino , you're doing so good .\n[doctor] all right . ears look okay . we're going to slide you forward so you do n't bump your head when i lay you down .\n[patient_guest] hey , you're- hey you're okay . you're okay .\n[doctor] okay , you can go ahead and sit him back up if you like .\n[patient_guest] all right . thank you .\n[doctor] all right . so , he's just kind of getting started with this , and i think we're seeing something viral right now . often sinus infections will start out as a virus and then will become bacterial infections if left alone and does n't go away . but , i do n't think he needs any antibiotics , at least not at this point in time . um , keep up with the fluids , rest , and i would watch him very carefully for a barking cough . if he does get a barky cough , then that tends to be a little bit more significant and a little more severe . so , if he develops a barky cough , i want you to give him a half a teaspoon of his sister's medicine .\n[doctor] you know , i'm almost tempted to give you some of the medicine because they're probably sharing the same virus .\n[patient_guest] okay .\n[doctor] actually , i will . i'll go ahead and just give you some as well .\n[patient_guest] okay . okay .\n[doctor] but , if he does n't become barky , you do n't have to use it . it only works for the barky cough .\n[patient_guest] mm-hmm , got it .\n[doctor] okay . we'll do the same thing with him , as long as nothing gets worse , and we'll see him back in one week . so , it wo n't get rid of a regular cough . he can use zarbee's , but use the dose for kids under a year of age . so , if you wan na get some of that , you can definitely try that for him , it can help out a little bit with the regular cough .\n[patient_guest] i do have a question . do you or do you not give honey to babies ?\n[doctor] yes , that's a great question . you do n't give honey to kids under a year , instead , you can give them agave , which is a different type of nectar . um , now you can give honey to his older sister , that is okay , but for him , it would not be very good because his stomach acid's not good enough to break down the botulism spores . so , it'd cause him harm . um , you should look at the package of say , honey nut cheerios . it says right on there to not give it to a baby .\n[patient_guest] okay .\n[doctor] now , whether that would really hurt a baby , i am unsure , but it has real honey in it . so , no honey for him , but agave is definitely fine .\n[patient_guest] okay . so , zarbee's for the stuffy nose .\n[doctor] yes , zarbee's .\n[patient_guest] and then you said , uh , which medicine to give him just in case ?\n[doctor] i'm gon na give him the same medicine as his sister , and just hang onto it , um , just to watch and see . if this was a monday and we had a whole week to watch , i would say to just call us if things got worse , um , but since , um , if it's gon na be the weekend , and things might worsen tonight or tomorrow night , i'd rather you have just what you need on hand .\n[patient_guest] okay .\n[doctor] right , does that make sense ?\n[patient_guest] yeah , yeah . that makes sense .\n[doctor] okay , great . and that way you do n't have to share , um , with his sister .\n[patient_guest] right , okay .\n[doctor] and since he's about half her size , we'll do half the dose , which is a half a teaspoon .\n[patient_guest] okay . will this information all be in the papers ?\n[doctor] yes . and so , if he ends up starting the medicine , just give him a half a teaspoon for five days .\n[patient_guest] okay .\n[doctor] yeah , that's the only thing it wo n't say is , \" as needed , \" or anything like that .\n[patient_guest] mm-hmm , understood , thank you .\n[doctor] you're welcome .\n[patient_guest] and the cradle cap ?\n[doctor] what i would do is use something like either head & shoulder's , or selsun blue , or nizoral ad . now , do n't get the extra strength stuff , just use the regular strength . um , cradle cap , it's just basically a fancy way of saying dandruff . so , those shampoos will help get rid of it . it's not an immediate thing 'cause they , um , they are all dead scales , and you still have to brush them off . so , continue to use the soft brush and some baby oil , or something that will help get the scales out , and those shampoos will actually help to prevent it as well . use it two times per week , not every day , but maybe twice a week .\n[doctor] so , two days between shampooing , use what you normally use any other time . and then , often , within six weeks or so , you'll notice that the-the cradle cap is just , um , not coming back anymore . but , he has to be careful because it's not ph balanced for eyes . so , just make sure when you're rinsing his hair you avoid his eyes .\n[patient_guest] okay . okay .\n[doctor] all right . and , if it keeps getting worse , definitely let us know .\n[patient_guest] okay . sounds good .\n[doctor] good . and , since they do n't have covid-19 , you can go right ahead and check out .\n[patient_guest] okay . and both appointments in the week ?\n[doctor] correct . we'll see you all then . bye randy , feel better .\n[patient_guest] all right , great . thank you so much .\n[doctor] you are welcome , and have a good rest of your day .\n</conversation>\nThe generated note will be provided in these tags:\n<response>\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:\nRandy Gutierrez, a toddler born on 8/10/2020, presents with symptoms beginning last night, including runny nose, nasal congestion, and a cough. He has been pulling on his ears and rubbing his nose. He has a low-grade fever of 100.3\u00b0F rectally, and has experienced decreased appetite, especially with his second bottle today. He appears irritable and has difficulty sleeping. No recent exposure to confirmed illnesses, but his older sister and a playmate with sinus infection have been in contact. He has been using saline nasal spray, humidifier, and Vicks on his feet. No current use of antibiotics.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM:\nVital signs: Temperature 100.3\u00b0F. General: Irritable but alert. ENT: Ears appear normal on exam. Nose: Congested with clear mucus. Throat: No abnormalities noted. Lungs: Clear to auscultation. Skin: Cradle cap noted, worsened since last visit. No signs of distress or severe respiratory effort.\n\nRESULTS:\nRectal temperature recorded at 100.3\u00b0F. No abnormal findings on ear exam. Cradle cap worsened; recommended treatment includes regular use of gentle dandruff shampoos (Head & Shoulders, Selsun Blue, or Nizoral AD) twice weekly and gentle brushing with baby oil. No laboratory tests performed at this visit.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\n1. Viral upper respiratory infection likely of viral etiology; no antibiotics indicated at this time. Continue supportive care with fluids, rest, and monitoring. Watch for development of a barky cough, which would suggest croup; if occurs, administer half a teaspoon of sister\u2019s medication. Prescribed a half teaspoon of medication (similar to sister\u2019s) to have on hand for potential worsening symptoms, to be used only if a barky cough develops. Advise use of Zarbee\u2019s for cough relief in infants under one year. No honey given due to age; recommend agave if needed. Follow-up in one week or sooner if symptoms worsen. \n2. Cradle cap management: Continue gentle shampooing with regular-strength dandruff shampoo twice weekly and use a soft brush with baby oil to help remove scales. Avoid eye contact during rinsing. Expect improvement over six weeks.\n3. Education provided regarding medication use, symptom monitoring, and hygiene measures. No COVID-19 concerns at this time.\n4. Scheduled follow-up appointments in one week for ongoing assessment.\n</response>\nThe reference note will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nCHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nCough, nasal congestion, and rhinorrhea.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nRandy Gutierrez is a 9-month-old male who is being evaluated today for a cough, nasal congestion, and rhinorrhea. He is accompanied by his mother.\n\nSymptoms began yesterday around dinnertime with clear nasal drainage, pulling on his ears bilaterally, and rubbing his nose frequently. He does not have a barky cough or a sore throat. His rectal temperature was 100.3 degrees. The patient did consume a 7 ounce bottle this morning, but mostly denied the next offered bottle and declined cereal. He is irritable and having trouble falling asleep, described \u201clike he is fighting it\u201d.\n\nThe patient has been exposed to an older sister who is sick and a cousin who has a sinus infection.\n\nTreatment has included saline nasal spray, Tylenol, baby Vick's, and a humidifier. When the patient aroused this morning, he was warm to the touch. When his sleeper was removed, he was quite sweaty despite the air conditioner being on.\n\nThe patient's dandruff is also worsening. The only tried treatment is Aveeno shampoo.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nOlder sister.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS\n\nTylenol PRN.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nTemperature 100.3 degrees.\n\nEars, Eyes, Nose, Throat\nNasal congestion, clear mucus, rhinorrhea. Bilateral pulling of ears, no sore throat or hoarseness.\n\nRespiratory\nPositive for cough.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\n\u2022 Viral infection\n\u2022 Dandruff\n\nPLAN\n\nViral infection\nThe patient presents with a viral infection and does not need antibiotics currently. I advised continuation of fluids, rest. Additionally, I suggested trying Zarbee\u2019s for children under 1 years old. If a croup cough develops, the patient will receive a 0.5 teaspoon.\n\nI also provided counseling to the mother to avoid giving honey to the patient for his first year of life due to botulism spores.\n\nDandruff\nThe patient is experiencing worsening symptoms of dandruff. I recommended Head and Shoulders shampoo, Selsun Blue, or Nizoral A-D 2 times per week, combined with his usual shampoo. I counseled the mother that she should be careful not to get the shampoo in the patient eyes and to not use the extra strength shampoos. Additionally, he may also use baby oil and a soft brush on the area.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nReturn in one week for a re-check.\n\n</gold_response>\nCarefully review the <response> based on the <conversation> and compare it to the <gold_response> when needed.\n\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Does the note provide correct clinical information based on the conversation?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the note include all important medical details from the conversation?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the note written clearly and organized in a standard clinical format for clinicians\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

She is accompanied by her mother today.\n\nKayla states her acne started approximately 2 years ago and it is present almost every day. The patient\u2019s mother notes that the most significant acne flares started in the fall when she was playing school sports. It does not tend to flare with her periods. Kayla reports that today is a good day for her acne. She denies any significant acne present on the chest or back. There are no associated symptoms, including no itching, bleeding, or pain.\n\nThe patient has been washing her face regularly. Her acne regimen includes washing her face in the morning with Persa-Gel and at night e.l.f. SuperClarify Cleanser along with toner and Persa-Gel. This regimen is somewhat helpful. She wears sunscreen in the summer SPF 30.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nLives with parents and sister. They have a dog, bird, and rabbits in the home. She is in the 7th grade and active in basketball, volleyball, and tap dancing.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY\n\nNo significant family medical history.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nIntegumentary\nFull exam is performed today except for under the underwear and under the bra. There are multiple benign nevi on the trunk and extremities. Scattered skin-colored papules, open and closed comedones, and erythematous papules on the face, primarily on the forehead, with also some on the central cheeks and chin. The chest and back are relatively spared. The remainder of examination is normal.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\n\u2022 Comedonal acne.\n\u2022 Multiple benign melanocytic nevi of upper and lower extremities and trunk.\n\nKayla Ward is a 15-year-old female seen today for new acne evaluation. Full skin examination revealed mild to moderate comedonal acne with a small inflammatory component and multiple benign melanocytic nevi of upper and lower extremities and trunk.\n\nPLAN\n\nComedonal acne.\nWe discussed the diagnosis, etiology, and treatment options. I recommend starting with topical therapy first. The patient was instructed to wash face every morning with a mild cleanser, then use a non-comedogenic moisturizer with sunscreen SPF 30 of higher. In the evening, wash face with same mild cleanser and allow to dry. Apply a thin layer of topical retinoid, Retin-A 0.1% gel, to acne prone areas. Start off using a few nights a week, slowly work up to using every night. If it is very expensive or not covered by insurance, you can try Differin gel over the counter. Your topical retinoid will cause sun sensitivity, so you will need to wear sunscreen when you are outside. It may also cause some dryness or irritation.\n\nMultiple benign melanocytic nevi of upper and lower extremities and trunk.\nReassurance given moles are normal in appearance and have no concerning characteristics. Will continue to monitor for progression or changes in 6 months.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nFollow recommended cleaning regimen.\nStart Retin-A 0.1% topical gel, apply to acne prone areas, titrate as instructed.\nFollow up in 6 months.\n\n</gold_response>\nCarefully review the <response> based on the <conversation> and compare it to the <gold_response> when needed.\n\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Does the note provide correct clinical information based on the conversation?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the note include all important medical details from the conversation?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the note written clearly and organized in a standard clinical format for clinicians\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

    "predicted_text": "**HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:**  \nJulia Jones, a 25-year-old female, presents for a consultation regarding bilateral breast reduction due to symptomatic macromastia. She reports longstanding symptoms, including back and neck pain since high school, which she attributes to her large breasts. She experiences shoulder strap indentations and discomfort during physical activities such as working out, jumping, and running. She has attempted nonsurgical treatments with minimal relief. She reports her breasts are always sweaty and occasionally experience numbness or tingling in the nipples. She is considering surgery to alleviate symptoms and improve appearance, with a desire to reduce her breast size to a B cup. She has a family history of breast cancer (mother diagnosed at age 40) and is currently on a health insurance plan that will change in July. She has no children but may plan future pregnancies.\n\n**PHYSICAL EXAM:**  \nInspection reveals asymmetrical breasts with severe ptosis bilaterally. No nipple retraction or discharge noted. No tenderness, palpable masses, or axillary lymphadenopathy. The patient\u2019s breasts are large, with a G cup size, and she exhibits shoulder strap indentations. No skin rashes or signs of infection. Nipple sensation is generally intact, with a slight possibility of alteration post-surgery.\n\n**RESULTS:**  \nMeasurements taken during the exam indicate asymmetry and significant breast size. Based on her body surface area (BSA 2.65) and the Schnur scale, an estimated resection weight of approximately 1,792 grams is planned, which may necessitate the use of a nipple graft due to the size of the breasts. No abnormal findings on physical exam aside from asymmetry and ptosis.\n\n**ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:**  \nJulia Jones is an appropriate candidate for bilateral reduction mammoplasty to address symptomatic macromastia. The procedure will involve removal of excess breast tissue and skin, elevation of the nipple, and reshaping of the breasts, with an expected resection weight of around 1,792 grams. The surgery will likely be an anchor incision approach, with potential for nipple grafting given the large size. Postoperative care includes overnight hospitalization, drain placement for approximately one week, activity restrictions (no heavy lifting or driving for 2-3 weeks), and scar management. Risks include altered nipple sensation and potential impact on future breastfeeding, though most patients experience symptom relief. The patient will wait until her new insurance plan is active in July for approval submission. Follow-up will be scheduled after insurance approval to determine the surgical date. Photos and documentation have been completed for insurance purposes.",

these tags:\n<conversation>\nDoctor-patient dialogue:\n\n[doctor] patient is julia jones , date of birth 5/16/1996 . she is a new breast reduction consult . hello , how are you doing today ? i'm dr. gonzalez . it's nice to meet you .\n[patient] nice to meet you , ma'am . how are you ?\n[doctor] i'm doing good , thank you . so you're here to discuss a breast reduction , correct ?\n[patient] yes . that's right .\n[doctor] okay . perfect . let me just get logged in , here . have you met with anyone before about a breast reduction ?\n[patient] no , i have n't .\n[doctor] okay . and how long have you been considering this ?\n[patient] it's probably been about six or seven years . but i mean , it's always been in the back of my mind .\n[doctor] well , i perform a lot of breast reduction surgeries , pretty much every week , so it is a very common procedure .\n[patient] okay , that's reassuring .\n[doctor] yeah . so what i wan na do first is just get a little bit of history about the sort of symptoms that you're having . and then i'll do a quick exam .\n[patient] okay . that sounds good .\n[doctor] and then we'll talk more about the surgery and what it entails . and , um , at this point , who is your insurance provider ?\n[patient] i have blue cross blue shield . well , actually , my husband just accepted a new job , and i will be on his plan , uh , which i believe is not going to be blue cross , but it may be changing .\n[doctor] okay . what we typically do when we do a breast reduction consult , i'll document your symptoms , symptoms , we'll take some pictures , then , um , they get sent to the insurance company . and what they'll do is decide whether it's approved , or medically necessary , or not . but we wan na make sure we send it to the right insurance . do you know when you'll be on the new plan ?\n[patient] most likely july .\n[doctor] okay . so we may just wait until july to submit for approval at that time .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] so regarding your symptoms , do you experience back pain ?\n[patient] well , i've been going to the chiropractor for a few years . i do have a lotta pain here and here . but i do n't know if it's all from my breasts or not . it gets painful and builds up . so i think i could attribute it to my breasts , when i'm working at my desk all day .\n[doctor] okay . and in your neck and your upper back . and how long has this been going on ? would you say five years , 10 years , or even since puberty ?\n[patient] i would say since i was in high school .\n[doctor] okay . and do you have the bra strap indentations in your shoulders ? um , i saw that you're wearing about a g cup .\n[patient] yes . i do get indentations , but i do n't really wear a regular bra that often . i mostly were a 34 e sports bra because it's more comfortable . and the others are expensive in my size .\n[doctor] yeah , i have heard that as well . and , um , have you had any children , or are you planning to have any children in the future ?\n[patient] no , i do not have any kids now . but we might plan to in the future .\n[doctor] okay . and at this time , are you experiencing any numbness or tingling in the s- in the hands or any nipple pain ?\n[patient] sometimes , yes .\n[doctor] okay . and rashes , do you get any rashes underneath your breasts ? and , and it could be from sweating .\n[patient] no , but they are always sweaty .\n[doctor] okay . and then do you feel like your activities are limited because of the size ?\n[patient] there's certain things i do when i have to hold them , like working out and any jumping or running . and it hurts .\n[doctor] and it hurts , okay . and , and you saw a chiropractor . but what about physical therapy for your back pain ? or do you take any pain medicine for it ?\n[patient] y- no , but i do take a migraine medication , propranolol .\n[doctor] that's okay . so let's see . i know that you have a history of breast cancer in your family . have you had any mammograms ? and how old was your mother when she had it ?\n[patient] mom was 40 . and they recommended me starting at age 30 for mammogram . i'm still ... i mean , i'm 25 . so i'm still a little bit young .\n[doctor] okay . and otherwise , it seems like you're really healthy ?\n[patient] yes , for the most part . i lost about 10 pounds over the past few months , and i still would like to lose about 20 more pounds .\n[doctor] congratulations . that's great . and then , um-\n[patient] thank you .\n[doctor] . so then ... you're welcome . and so do you use any tobacco , drugs , or alcohol ? and then , um , you said that you were going to school . what are you going to school for ?\n[patient] uh , i drink a little wine on occasion , and for school , i'm currently studying psychology .\n[doctor] okay , that's great . all right . so what we'll do is we'll go ahead and take a look . i'm gon na take a couple of measurements . and we'll kinda talk about the surgery afterwards . um , so go ahead and stand up for me , julia . okay . so , looking at the measurements , it looks like one breast is a little lower than the other .\n[patient] yeah .\n[doctor] okay . well , thank you so much . it looks like i have all the measurements that we need . you can go ahead and cover up now .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] so i think you're a great candidate for a breast reduction . when we talk about a breast reduction , what happens is that we remove the tissue out of the breast .\n[patient] okay . that's fine .\n[doctor] and we would then lift them and elevate the nipple position in order to help with your back pain , neck pain , and because i'm a plastic surgeon , of course i want them to look nice as well .\n[patient] right .\n[doctor] so typically , when you do the breast reduction , we make an incision around the nipple straight down and then underneath . and it kinda looks like , um , an anchor below . then straight down , and underneath , and through that incision , we're able to f- to lift the breast . and we'll take off any extra fat and breash- breast tissue . so that way it becomes smaller in size . and i noticed that you would like to be a b cup . so i do tell every patient we can make you as small as your blood supply allows . and what that means is we must move the nipple without cutting off any of its blood supply during the surgery .\n[patient] okay . well , thank you for explaining that .\n[doctor] you're welcome . and in your case , you'll probably be a small c. um , a b cup might be a little bit small , but we'll see once i'm doing the , the procedure for you .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] and typically the surgery takes about three hours . you will have drains , one in each side . and that helps prevent fluid from building up in the breast . and that stays in for about a week . and then we'll remove them in the clinic . and you'll have a clear plastic tape over your incision that should help with the scars . and , um , we've seen that patients who have lighter skin , the scars will tend to be red at first . and then it takes about a year for a scar to mature in line .\n[patient] okay . well , i'm not too worried about the scars .\n[doctor] okay . and i do like to keep patients overnight . it's just going to be for one night in the hospital . and we just wan na make sure your pain is controlled , make sure you're not nauseated , all of that stuff . some patients wan na go home that same day . but you know that some people get nauseated , and the last thing that i want is for you to be vomiting at home alone without the , the support here at the facility .\n[patient] okay , yeah , that sounds good .\n[doctor] okay . and then about 30 % of patients say that they can not breastfeed after a breast reduction , and the reason is the breast is made up of fat . and it's also made up of a gland . and the gland is what produces the milk .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] and so in order to reduce the size of the breast , we have to take out both the fat and the glands . so it just depends on how much is left , whether you can breastfeed in the future . and then also , the breast will change over time . if you , um , gain weight , they will get larger , things like that .\n[patient] yeah , okay .\n[doctor] and if you have children , they will change as well . they will enlarge , especially if you can breastfeed . but they'll go back down and will appear , um , a little bit deflated .\n[patient] yeah . i do n't know if i'm interested in breastfeeding .\n[doctor] okay . um , the hormones of pregnancy , though , will change the breasts , so that's just something to be aware of , and i tell all younger patients that .\n[patient] okay , yeah . absolutely .\n[doctor] and then typically nipple sensation is fine after a breast reduction , but there is a slight chance that you'll have an alteration in the nipple sensation or not have any sensation in the nipple . generally the nipple is just fine unless it is a massive reduction . and it's quite normal after surgery to be a little bit bruised , and then it just takes some time for that to go away .\n[patient] yeah , okay .\n[doctor] but other than that , you know , most patients are very happy after the breast reduction because the symptoms of the back pain , the neck pain , you can feel relief almost immediately . so do you have any questions , julia , about the process or anything like that ?\n[patient] no , not really .\n[doctor] okay . and , i do think you're a good candidate for it . and i think you'll benefit from it as well .\n[patient] good . i look forward to a relief .\n[doctor] i think you just have to do it when you are ready , when you know that you feel like it's a good time , because it is a commitment , and you will have some activity restrictions for about six weeks after surgery , uh , no heavy lifting . and i do say no driving for two to three weeks . and the drains stay in , like i said , for about a week .\n[patient] okay . well , i am ready as soon as my insurance is switched over .\n[doctor] okay . well , i think from this point , if you want to , we can take photos today , while you're here . i have all the documentation now in the note about your symptoms , and that's what the insurance company is going to look for . so thank you for answering those questions . so once we have the new provider , we'll go ahead and get that submitted . and then , when they approve it , um , what the office will do , is they'll work with you on a surgery date , and then we'll meet again right before the surgery to answer any last minute questions and go over the instructions in more detail , things like that .\n[patient] okay . well , i will notify the office as soon as i have the insurance information .\n[doctor] that sounds great . and then we can get it all in process . and it was so nice to meet you . and catherine will be right in to get your photos . julia jones is a 25 year old female with symptomatic macromastia ,

Currently she has Blue Cross Blue Shield insurance but will be added to her spouse\u2019s insurance plan in 07/2021.\n\nCurrent breast size is a G cup, although she primarily wears a 34 E sports bra for comfort, and desired breast size is a B or C cup. No prior pregnancies, potentially planning on pregnancies in the future, and unsure of breast feeding.\n\nThe patient endorses back and neck pain since she was in high school. Her back and neck pain has been managed by a chiropractor for a few years. She reports weight loss of 10 pounds over the past few months and would like to lose an additional 20 pounds.\n\nShe endorses the following symptoms because of her macromastia for 7 years:\n\nChronic upper back pain: Yes.\nBra strap grooving in shoulders or indentation on lateral chest wall: Occasionally.\nNeck pain: Yes.\nNipple pain or numbness: Yes.\nParesthesia of the hands or arms: Yes.\nIntertrigo, rash or yeast or other skin problems beneath breasts: Yes, persistent sweating.\nStooped posture: Yes.\nPhysical activity limited by breast size: Yes.\n\nThe patient has undergone the following therapies:\nPhysical therapy: No.\n\nSpecial bras: Yes.\nNon-narcotic pain medication: No.\nNarcotic pain medication: No.\n\nHer previous breast surgery includes:\nPrevious reconstruction: No.\n\nPAST HISTORY\n\nMedical\nSignificant for migraine headaches.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY\n\nMother with prior history of breast cancer at age 40.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nTobacco: No prior history.\nAlcohol: Socially. One glass per week.\nDrug: No prior history.\nOccupational and Educational: Currently studying to be a psychologist.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS\n\nPropranolol for migraine prevention.\n\nVITALS\n\nBSA 2.65\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nBreasts\nInspection reveals\u202fasymmetrical\u202fbreasts with severe ptosis bilaterally. There is no nipple retraction or discharge bilaterally. No breast tenderness, masses, or axillary lymphadenopathy is palpable.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\n\u2022 Macromastia.\n\nJulia Jones is a 25-year-old female with symptomatic macromastia presenting for evaluation of breast reduction. The patient has attempted non-surgical treatments with minimal relief and is an ideal candidate for bilateral reduction mammoplasty. Her minimum required resection based on a BSA of 2.65 with the Schnur scale is 1792 g, which should be attainable. Given her extremely large breasts and the measurements above, there is potential for using a free nipple graft.\n\nPLAN\n\nAn extensive discussion of breast reduction surgery was performed with the patient with consideration of the patient's age, co-morbidities, previous surgical history, body habitus, BMI, and smoking history. Surgical time, immediate recovery course, and longer term recovery course were discussed. Relief of the patient's current symptoms related to macromastia was not guaranteed though is expected to improve. Specific breast size was discussed, also not guaranteed. I explained the expected outcomes of using a free nipple graft such as an insensate nipple and an inability to breast feed. The patient understands that the decision for a free nipple graft will be made intraoperatively based on assessment of nipple perfusion.\n\nRisks and benefits of were discussed with the patient The patient understands the above risks, benefits and alternatives to surgery and wishes to proceed with bilateral reduction mammaplasty.\n\nThe patient will be switching to a different insurance policy in 07/2021. Once we get the new insurance information from the patient, we will submit it to her insurance company. If approved, she will return for preoperative counseling and consent.\n\nReturn to clinic prior to scheduled surgery date for preoperative counseling and consent.\n</gold_response>\nCarefully review the <response> based on the <conversation> and compare it to the <gold_response> when needed.\n\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Does the note provide correct clinical information based on the conversation?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the note include all important medical details from the conversation?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the note written clearly and organized in a standard clinical format for clinicians\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

    "predicted_text": "**HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:**  \nMrs. Wood, a 44-year-old woman, presents for a renal ultrasound due to hematuria. She reports passing two small stones last week and has experienced episodes of bright red urine (\"cherry Kool-Aid\" color) over the past six weeks, along with painful urination during that time, rated as 8/10 in pain. She currently denies flank pain or tenderness. She notes that her symptoms have improved since passing the stones.\n\n**PHYSICAL EXAM:**  \nOn examination, the abdomen is soft with no flank tenderness. No abnormal findings noted on the vaginal exam. Vital signs are within normal limits. No flank pain or tenderness observed.\n\n**RESULTS:**  \nUrinalysis was negative for leukocytes, nitrates, protein, ketones, bilirubin, and glucose; with a trace amount of blood present. Urine was yellow, clear, with pH 5.5, specific gravity 1.020, and urobilinogen 0.2. Renal ultrasound showed normal-sized kidneys (right 10 cm, left 10.8 cm) with no stones, masses, or hydronephrosis in the right kidney. The left kidney contains a 6 mm non-obstructing stone.\n\n**ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:**  \nMrs. Wood's hematuria is attributed to nephrolithiasis, with a recent history of passing stones and current imaging showing a non-obstructing 6 mm stone in the left kidney. No surgical intervention is indicated at this time. She is advised to increase hydration to approximately 125 ounces of water daily, avoid sugary drinks like Mountain Dew, and reduce intake of foods high in sodium and oxalate (e.g., spinach, chocolate, beets, rhubarb, soy). She received educational materials on dietary modifications. Follow-up is not scheduled unless symptoms recur or worsen; she is instructed to seek emergency care if experiencing severe pain or significant hematuria. The primary diagnosis is hematuria secondary to urolithiasis.",

She reports passing two small stones last week and has experienced episodes of bright red urine (\"cherry Kool-Aid\" color) over the past six weeks, along with painful urination during that time, rated as 8/10 in pain. She currently denies flank pain or tenderness. She notes that her symptoms have improved since passing the stones.\n\n**PHYSICAL EXAM:**  \nOn examination, the abdomen is soft with no flank tenderness. No abnormal findings noted on the vaginal exam. Vital signs are within normal limits. No flank pain or tenderness observed.\n\n**RESULTS:**  \nUrinalysis was negative for leukocytes, nitrates, protein, ketones, bilirubin, and glucose; with a trace amount of blood present. Urine was yellow, clear, with pH 5.5, specific gravity 1.020, and urobilinogen 0.2. Renal ultrasound showed normal-sized kidneys (right 10 cm, left 10.8 cm) with no stones, masses, or hydronephrosis in the right kidney. The left kidney contains a 6 mm non-obstructing stone.\n\n**ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:**  \nMrs. Wood's hematuria is attributed to nephrolithiasis, with a recent history of passing stones and current imaging showing a non-obstructing 6 mm stone in the left kidney. No surgical intervention is indicated at this time. She is advised to increase hydration to approximately 125 ounces of water daily, avoid sugary drinks like Mountain Dew, and reduce intake of foods high in sodium and oxalate (e.g., spinach, chocolate, beets, rhubarb, soy). She received educational materials on dietary modifications. Follow-up is not scheduled unless symptoms recur or worsen; she is instructed to seek emergency care if experiencing severe pain or significant hematuria. The primary diagnosis is hematuria secondary to urolithiasis.\n</response>\nThe reference note will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nCHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nHematuria.\nChronic urolithiasis.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nMrs. Kelly Wood is a 41-year-old female established patient with chronic urolithiasis who returns in follow up for renal ultrasound due to hematuria.\n\nThe patient reports having intermittent episodes of gross hematuria over the past several months. she states she had multiple voids in one day where the color of her urine was like cherry Kool-Aid last week; then passed 2 small stone like structures. Pain at the time was 8 out of 10 on a scale of 10. she currently denies any flank pain.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS\n\nAlavert 10 mg tablet once daily.\n\nALLERGIES\n\nNo known drug allergies.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nGenitourinary: Normal vaginal exam.\n\nRESULTS\n\nRenal Ultrasound\nImpression: Right kidney is 10 cm in length by 5 cm wide. There are no stones, masses, or hydronephrosis. The left kidney is 10.8 cm in length and 5 cm wide. There is a 6 mm left renal stone, non-obstructing. 533 ml pre void and 0 ml post void.\n\nUrine Dipstick without Micro\nColor: Yellow.\nAppearance: Clear.\nLeukocytes: Negative.\nNitrate: Negative.\nUrobilinogen: 0.2 EU/dL.\nProtein: Negative.\npH: 5.5\nBlood: Trace, intact.\nSpecific gravity: 1.020\nKetone: Negative.\nBilirubin: Negative.\nGlucose: Negative.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\n\u2022 Hematuria.\n\u2022 Chronic urolithiasis.\n\nMrs. Wood presents today for renal ultrasound. The patient has had recurrent episodes of hematuria over the past few months secondary to chronic urolithiasis. Mrs. Wood reports passing two small stone like structures last week. Urinalysis today was notable for only a trace amount of blood and the renal ultrasound revealed a 6 mm non-obstructing renal stone in the left kidney.\n\nPLAN\n\nNo surgical intervention is recommended, and the patient would like to discuss urolithiasis prevention. We had a very lengthy discussion with regards to urolithiasis formation and treating the underlying cause to prevent reoccurrence and associated potential dietary factors that could be involved with urolithiasis formation.\n\nIt is recommended that the patient maintain a healthy diet; limit salt, and animal protein. she should increase fluid consumption; adequate intake is half of her body weight in ounces of water daily and avoid sugary drinks. A copy of the dietary recommendations and avoidances was provided to the patient for reference. We will continue to monitor annually with renal ultrasound unless new symptoms develop. The patient voiced understanding and agreed with the recommended medical treatment plan.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nFollow up in 1 year with renal ultrasound, sooner should symptoms arise. Should you develop sudden onset of severe pain or gross hematuria go to the emergency room.\n\n</gold_response>\nCarefully review the <response> based on the <conversation> and compare it to the <gold_response> when needed.\n\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Does the note provide correct clinical information based on the conversation?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the note include all important medical details from the conversation?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the note written clearly and organized in a standard clinical format for clinicians\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

She reports good overall condition with recent improvement in joint pain. She has been on a tapering dose of prednisone, currently taking one tablet daily, which she feels is sufficient. She occasionally takes an extra dose (about once weekly) due to increased foot pain, often related to her desk job and days off with more movement. She reports that methotrexate has been helpful for her joint symptoms. She experienced significant discomfort after her first COVID vaccine dose, which she attributes to missing methotrexate that week; she resumed methotrexate after the adverse symptoms. She also notes new bruising, which she attributes to prednisone use.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM:\nMs. Gomez appears well and in no acute distress. Examination reveals mild joint tenderness in the feet and knees, with good range of motion. No swelling or deformities noted. Nail examination shows ridges consistent with psoriasis. No active skin lesions observed during the visit. Bruises are visible on her skin, correlating with her report of increased bruising.\n\nRESULTS:\nNo laboratory results are available at this visit; plans include obtaining blood work for monitoring. No recent labs have been performed since her last visit. The patient was advised to have blood drawn for routine monitoring, including CBC and liver function tests, prior to continuing methotrexate.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\nMs. Gomez's psoriatic arthritis is well-controlled on methotrexate, with recent improvement in joint symptoms. She is tolerating the medication well, aside from bruising likely related to prednisone. The plan is to discontinue prednisone today, with close monitoring for resolution of bruising. She will continue methotrexate, with blood work scheduled for monitoring of blood counts and liver function. She was advised to stop by the front desk to schedule blood tests. Follow-up is planned in three months to reassess disease activity and medication tolerance. She was counseled on the potential side effect of bruising from prednisone and advised to report any new or worsening symptoms.",

She reports good overall condition with recent improvement in joint pain. She has been on a tapering dose of prednisone, currently taking one tablet daily, which she feels is sufficient. She occasionally takes an extra dose (about once weekly) due to increased foot pain, often related to her desk job and days off with more movement. She reports that methotrexate has been helpful for her joint symptoms. She experienced significant discomfort after her first COVID vaccine dose, which she attributes to missing methotrexate that week; she resumed methotrexate after the adverse symptoms. She also notes new bruising, which she attributes to prednisone use.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM:\nMs. Gomez appears well and in no acute distress. Examination reveals mild joint tenderness in the feet and knees, with good range of motion. No swelling or deformities noted. Nail examination shows ridges consistent with psoriasis. No active skin lesions observed during the visit. Bruises are visible on her skin, correlating with her report of increased bruising.\n\nRESULTS:\nNo laboratory results are available at this visit; plans include obtaining blood work for monitoring. No recent labs have been performed since her last visit. The patient was advised to have blood drawn for routine monitoring, including CBC and liver function tests, prior to continuing methotrexate.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\nMs. Gomez's psoriatic arthritis is well-controlled on methotrexate, with recent improvement in joint symptoms. She is tolerating the medication well, aside from bruising likely related to prednisone. The plan is to discontinue prednisone today, with close monitoring for resolution of bruising. She will continue methotrexate, with blood work scheduled for monitoring of blood counts and liver function. She was advised to stop by the front desk to schedule blood tests. Follow-up is planned in three months to reassess disease activity and medication tolerance. She was counseled on the potential side effect of bruising from prednisone and advised to report any new or worsening symptoms.\n</response>\nThe reference note will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nCHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nPsoriatic arthritis management.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nJudy Gomez is a 61-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for ongoing management of psoriatic arthritis.\n\nMs. Gomez is currently taking methotrexate and prednisone 1 mg daily. She believes methotrexate has been relieving her joint pain.\n\nThe patient reports she has been doing well since her last visit. She has been able to decrease her prednisone dose to 1 mg daily; however, she took 2 mg for a couple of days due to increased pain in her bilateral feet.\n\nThe patient states when she received her first COVID-19 vaccine she held her methotrexate and felt \"horrible\" all week until the next Wednesday when she took it. She felt better by the end of the week. She did not hold methotrexate for her second COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nMusculoskeletal: Full range of motion.

She reports no current chest pain but has experienced severe bilateral leg pain over the past month, which is managed with pain medications. She notes increased fatigue over the past six months, with a 70-80% worsening since then. She experiences shortness of breath when walking briskly, overexerting, or drinking a glass of water quickly, with limited walking ability to the end of her driveway or around the cul-de-sac. She reports episodes of dizziness and lightheadedness, which are intermittent and managed with medication, but no passing out. She has swelling in her ankles for approximately six months, fluctuating in severity, and has experienced weight loss from 130 to 120 pounds over the past year. No fevers, chills, or recent illnesses are reported. Family history includes a son with a heart attack, a brother with a stroke, and a sister with heart problems.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM:\nThe patient appears constitutionally elderly, in no acute distress. Cardiovascular exam reveals a normal S1 and S2 with a regular rate, but a 4/6 systolic murmur heard at the right upper sternal border with mild radiation to the carotids. Neurologic examination shows a normal gait for age. No signs of volume overload are observed.\n\nRESULTS:\nAn EKG demonstrates sinus rhythm with frequent premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) and an anterior septum infarct pattern. The echocardiogram is ordered to assess cardiac structure and function, with particular attention to the suspected aortic stenosis. Blood pressure is within normal limits, and current medications include amlodipine, lisinopril, levothyroxine, and simvastatin. No known drug allergies. Family history confirms a familial pattern of heart disease. Physical exam findings suggest possible moderate to severe aortic stenosis, with diastolic dysfunction noted in previous records. No significant volume overload or acute cardiac decompensation observed today.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\nThe primary concern is aortic stenosis, likely moderate to severe, evidenced by the systolic murmur and clinical presentation. An echocardiogram will be performed today to evaluate valve morphology and cardiac function. Depending on the severity of aortic stenosis, options such as transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) or surgical valve replacement will be considered, though surgical intervention may not be suitable given her age. The PVCs observed on EKG will be monitored, and a heart monitor may be considered if symptoms or burden increase. Her leg pain and swelling are ongoing; evaluation for possible TAVR is planned due to bilateral leg pain, with the potential to reassess statin therapy after consultation with her primary care provider. Her blood pressure remains stable; no medication adjustments are necessary. Her hypothyroidism is well-controlled with levothyroxine. Follow-up is scheduled in 3-4 weeks to review echocardiogram results and determine further management.",

good afternoon . how are you today ?\n[patient] i'm good , thank you .\n[doctor] good . well , what brings you in to see me today ?\n[patient] well , my doctor says that i have a heart murmur .\n[doctor] okay .\n[patient] so i do n't know how big a heart murmur i have , or really even what it is .\n[doctor] okay . so how long have you had that for ? do you have any idea , or is that completely new as far as you know ?\n[patient] yeah , she said it's a new worrisome heart murmur . so of course , i'm worried as well .\n[doctor] got it . okay . and are you having any symptoms at all ?\n[patient] i do n't think so . i do n't know what symptoms i should be having .\n[doctor] okay . well , so you are 100 , so we ca n't really get around that one . so i expect that you probably do n't move quite as fast as maybe you used to ?\n[patient] no , i definitely do n't .\n[doctor] okay . and do you notice that you have any chest pain or f- feel shortness of breath ?\n[patient] no , i do n't have any chest pain . um , my problem is i have severe pains in my legs , and so she had me going for a chest x-ray , and that was just last week .\n[doctor] okay .\n[patient] and so i started taking pain pills for my legs .\n[doctor] okay , got it , for the legs . and do you feel short of breath at all ?\n[patient] if i walk too fast or too long , or if i tried to drink a whole glass of water without stopping , then yeah , i do get short of breath that way .\n[doctor] okay . and how far can you walk before you feel short of breath or sort of overly fatigued ?\n[patient] well , i do have a walker now , so i do n't know . maybe when i walk to the end of the driveway or i walk around the culdesac .\n[doctor] got it . all right .\n[patient] so it is n't that bothersome to me at all . um , maybe more if i try to overdo it .\n[doctor] okay .\n[patient] then i , um , i get short of breath if i do overdo it though .\n[doctor] okay , got it . and so how different would you say , um , that the symptoms are now compared to like six months ago or a year ago ?\n[patient] i would say probably 70 to 80 % from about six months ago . before that i did n't notice anything at all .\n[doctor] okay . so do you feel like it's mainly the leg pain that seems to limit you ?\n[patient] my legs have been severe for about a month now .\n[doctor] okay . and how about , do you feel lightheaded or dizzy at all ?\n[patient] yeah . so i do take a pill for that when it does get bad .\n[doctor] okay .\n[patient] yeah , and i do n't take it every day , only when i do feel dizzy .\n[doctor] okay . and so how about any passing out at all ?\n[patient] no .\n[doctor] okay , good . and how about irregular heartbeats ? do you ever feel like your heart is going too fast or like it skips a beat ?\n[patient] i do n't notice it at all .\n[doctor] okay , great . and how about any swelling in the legs at all ?\n[patient] yeah , my ankles swell .\n[doctor] okay . and how long has this been going on ?\n[patient] um , i would say for probably six months . but it goes up and down , and sometimes it's worse than other times .\n[doctor] okay . and how about any recent weight gain or anything else like that ?\n[patient] um , i lost a little bit of weight , but i still weigh a 120 pounds , but i normally weigh about 130 pounds .\n[doctor] mm-hmm . okay .\n[patient] um , but that's been going down gradually for about a year .\n[doctor] okay . and then how about any fevers , chills or anything else that's , that's going on that you can think of ?\n[patient] no .\n[doctor] good . so mainly it sounds like you came in , um , mostly because of the murmur . is that right ? and sort of just kind of seeing what things look like ?\n[patient] yeah , that and i feel overly tired because i take all that medication .\n[doctor] okay . and so fatigue as well . and have you ever had any testing of your heart done ?\n[patient] i'm not really sure .\n[doctor] okay . it does look like you've had a decent number of sh- , uh , surgeries here , ?\n[patient] yeah , you name it .\n[doctor] all right . well , i wo n't make you repeat them since i do have a good record . um , but just give me just a second and i'm going to enter the ones we need , okay ? all right . got them . and then , are you taking all the medicines that you went through with madison ?\n[patient] yes .\n[doctor] okay , good . and looking at your family history , it looks like maybe your brother had a heart attack . is that correct ?\n[patient] it was actually my son , not my brother .\n[doctor] okay , i'll make that adjustment .\n[patient] um , but my brother did have a stroke . but that was because he had gotten sugar diabetes , and my eldest sister did have a heart problem as well .\n[doctor] okay , i see .\n[patient] yeah , so heart problems kinda run in the family .\n[doctor] okay . all right . well , it looks like also that you never smoked . that's excellent . and then no allergies to medicines that you know of , is that correct ?\n[patient] correct .\n[doctor] all right . well , let's do a quick exam .\n[patient] all right . sounds good .\n[doctor] all right . well , for physical exam , please use the regular template . all right , please just breathe normally . great . and now take a few deep breaths for me . all right . do you feel okay ? are you feeling any dizziness or anything ?\n[patient] no , i feel fine .\n[doctor] okay , great . all right . well , that is it for the exam .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] all right . so what i'm thinking is , let's go ahead and schedule you for an echocardiogram . it's a very common test and it just takes a picture of your heart . and it'll let me see how well your heart is actually working .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] and i can order that for today . um , do you have time to complete that ? it should n't take too long .\n[patient] yes , that's fine . i have time .\n[doctor] okay , great . so we will complete that today , um , to assess your overall cardiac structure and function , as well as , uh , the valve view of where diseased .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] and some hospital outcomes and what we might suggest to fix that out , i'll go over that . so one possible suspicion i'm having is it's called , um , aortic stenosis , and that just means that one of your main valves of your heart has narrowed a bit and the valve does n't really open , um , quite fully . and this could just reduce or block the blood flow from your heart into the main artery of your body , and that's called the aorta , into the rest of your body .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] and if this is severe , then we might wan na perform a procedure called the transcatheter aortic valve replacement , or we just call it tavr . and it is a minimally invasive procedure to replace the valve .\n[patient] well , i would have to think about that . i'm not too sure i'd wan na do that , given my age of all .\n[doctor] yeah , sure , no problem . and we do n't have to make any decisions today , just , you know , wanted to go over a couple of these things . um , but sometimes we can also perform a surgical aortic valve replacement , or it's called an savr . but really , because of your age and medical history , um , unfortunately , that would n't be a good option for you .\n[patient] i see . okay . well , i guess we'll see , um , what you see from , from the , um , test .\n[doctor] yeah , agreed . okay . and , um , so couple other things real quick . so it looked like your blood pressure looked really good today . so we're not going to change your amlodipine or lisinopril . so just continue taking those as you are currently .\n[patient] okay , good .\n[doctor] and then , it also looks like you're taking about 20 milligrams of simvastatin for your lipids . and i will pr- , um , defer to your pcp . however , given you are having leg pain in both your legs , and given your age and no history of coronary artery d- , artery disease , it is possible that you might be able to stop your statin .\n[patient] really ?\n[doctor] yeah , um , possibly . he would have to evaluate you , but it is certainly something to discuss with him . so i will send over the results of the echocardiogram and also my recommendations and then you guys can talk about the statin .\n[patient] okay , that sounds great . thank you .\n[doctor] you're welcome . and then , um , lastly , your hyperthyroidism , uh , i see you're taking levothyroxine . and again , no change here and you can just keep taking that as you have them .\n[patient] okay , i will .\n[doctor] all right . so we will see you back here in about three or four weeks to discuss the results and your next steps . um , and we'll , uh , take care of your echocardiogram today . um , any questions ?\n[patient] not that i can think of . thank you so much . and i think it looks good .\n[doctor] okay , awesome . all right . well , have a good rest of your day , and we'll see you soon .\n[doctor] for physical exam , constitutional elderly otherwise no acute distress . cardiovascular normal s1 and s2 is preserved with a normal rate and regular rhythm . there is a 4/6 systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border with , uhm , mild radiation to the carotids . neurologic gait is normal for age .\n[doctor] for assessment and plan , probably one

She denies chest pain, syncope, palpitations, fevers, or chills. She reports shortness of breath if she walks too fast, too long, or tries to drink a whole glass of water without stopping. The patient requires a walker and can walk around her cul-de-sac or to the end of the driveway without shortness of breath. Compared to 6 months ago, her functioning has declined 20-30%. Prior to 6 months, symptoms were absent. For the past month she has been experiencing severe, bilateral leg pain, which was limiting her mobility. She did see her doctor last week who completed a chest x-ray and prescribed pain medicine. Occasionally, she feels dizzy but takes medication for this and it subsides. Her ankles have been swelling for the past 6 months, but the swelling fluctuates day to day. Her weight has been slowly decreasing over the past year, with her current weight at 120 pounds, previous weight was 130 pounds. She also reports feeling \u201coverly tired\u201d but attributes this to her polypharmacy.\n\nThe patient is unsure if she has completed any cardiovascular testing.\n\nPAST HISTORY\n\nMedical\nHyperlipidemia.\nHypertension.\nHypothyroid.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nRequires a walker to ambulate.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY\n\nSon had a myocardial infarction.\nBrother had a stroke and has diabetes.\nOlder sister has an unknown heart problem.\nFamily is positive for heart disease.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS\n\nLevothyroxine.\nLisinopril.\nSimvastatin 20 mg.\nMeclizine.\nAmlodipine.\n\nALLERGIES\n\nNo known drug allergies.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nConstitutional\nElderly, no acute distress.\n\nCardiovascular\nNormal S1, S2 preserved, irregular rhythm and normal rate. 4/6 systolic murmur at the RUSB with mild radiation to the carotids.\n\nMusculoskeletal\nLower extremity edema\n\nNeurologic\nGait normal for age.\n\nRESULTS\n\nEKG\nImpression: Sinus rhythm with frequent PVCs as well as anterior septal infarct pattern.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\n\u2022 Cardiac murmur.\n\u2022 PVCs.\n\u2022 Hypertension.\n\u2022 Hyperlipidemia.\n\u2022 Hypothyroid.\n\u2022 Lightheadedness/dizziness.\n\nPLAN\n\nCardiac murmur\nDiana has a 4/6 systolic murmur at the RUSB with mild radiation to the carotids. This is most likely representative of aortic stenosis. She does have symptoms including a significant increase in fatigue over the last 6 months, shortness of breath, and some lightheadedness. This could be due to severe aortic stenosis, however, her S2 is relatively preserved which would be more consistent with moderate. She is unsure if she has had an echocardiogram, although some of her outside records do note diastolic dysfunction, so it is possible that she had one as some point in the past. We will order a repeat echocardiogram today to assess overall cardiac structure and function as well as valvular disease. If she does truly have severe aortic stenosis, I briefly discussed a TAVR procedure today as she is not a candidate for a surgical AVR given her age co-morbidities and frailty. She is unsure if she would be interested in this, but we will assess first with the echocardiogram and then discuss further at follow-up. She does not appear significantly volume overloaded today.\n\nPVCs\nHer referral mentions tachycardia. Her EKG today shows sinus rhythm with frequent PVCs as well as anterior septal infarct pattern. She does not have any significant palpitations. We will check an echocardiogram to assess overall cardiac structure and function. Depending on results as well as the severity of her aortic stenosis, we will need to consider an ischemic evaluation or possibly a heart monitor to assess the overall burden of PVCs. At this point, she is asymptomatic, so we will start with the echocardiogram only.\n\nHypertension\nShe is taking amlodipine and lisinopril. We will continue these as is.\n\nHyperlipidemia\nThis is managed by her PCP. She is on simvastatin 20 mg. She is having bilateral leg pain over the past month. This could be related to the simvastatin possibly and given her age, it would not be unreasonable to stop the simvastatin, but I will defer to her PCP. She has no known CAD but if we were to do a TAVR evaluation and this was discovered, a statin would be indicated.\n\nHypothyroidism\nShe takes levothyroxine for supplementation and will continue this as is.\n\nLightheadedness/dizziness\nShe is on meclizine for this. It is possible that some of her lightheadedness and dizziness are related to the aortic stenosis, and we will do an echocardiogram as noted above. She is also having some PVCs on her EKG, which could be contributing, but she does not feel palpitations. We will consider a monitor but start with the echocardiogram first as noted above.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nFollow-up in 3 to 4 weeks after her echocardiogram is done to discuss results and next steps.\n\n</gold_response>\nCarefully review the <response> based on the <conversation> and compare it to the <gold_response> when needed.\n\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Does the note provide correct clinical information based on the conversation?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the note include all important medical details from the conversation?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the note written clearly and organized in a standard clinical format for clinicians\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

your pulse ox is normal so that's good you do n't appear in any distress you may be might be a little bit nervous to come in and see me but looks pretty good i do not appreciate any rash on your body there is no angioedema which is just swelling of your lips like you mentioned no audible stridor which is a bad noise in your airway when it gets swollen so that's good news if you just want to take a deep breath listening to your lungs on your lungs exam i do appreciate some faint expiratory wheezing bilaterally in all lung fields so i know you had a chest x-ray when you came in i'm looking at that chest x-ray right now and your pulmonary function test and they were both normal so let's talk a little bit about what i think is going on for your first problem you have newly diagnosed allergic asthma so i want you to continue the albuterol inhaler i do n't want you to wait until your symptoms flare up or are bad take it as soon as you start to feel any symptoms at all i'm gon na prescribe

The onset of his symptoms began 2 years ago. He has noticed that his breathing is not what it used to be. He describes an increased need to catch his breath. The patient also reports he gets \u201cmid-shortness of breath\u201d without reason. He has been seen at an urgent care where he received a nebulizer treatment and was prescribed an inhaler, which he uses when his symptoms are present. The patient states his symptoms are aggravated by living with a cat in his house and are present even when the cat is not around or is outside. He has experienced epiphora with rheum present that he attributes to allergies. He has had diarrhea after consuming large amounts of alcohol. He denies any symptoms at this time including shortness of breath, rash, nausea, vomiting, and lip or throat swelling.

He will continue to use the albuterol inhaler; however, he should limit its use to when he is experiencing a severe flare-up of symptoms. I advised he should take it as soon as he starts to feel any symptoms at all. I have also prescribed the patient Singulair 10 mg to be taken once daily. This should help to decrease the occurrences of his asthma. I have also recommended we proceed with an allergy skin test to target what his triggers are in the hope that we can avoid any other management.

type of back pain before\n[patient] i had it once about three years ago but it went away after a day\n[doctor] okay and did you try anything for the pain yet did you take anything or have you have you tried icing\n[patient] put some ice on it and i tried two advils and it did n't help\n[doctor] okay does it get better when you're laying down sitting standing\n[patient] yeah i think the only thing that helped was a hot shower and it feels a little better when i sit\n[doctor] okay alright so you said you were raking leaves and now it's been kind of that weather outside for cleaning out the yard have you been doing a lot of yard work lately\n[patient] i i i normally do n't do any physical activity\n[doctor] yeah i hear you i make a i make my husband do all the yard work too so alright let me take a look at that low back if if you bend over does that hurt\n[patient] it hurts a little bit when i bend over yes\n[doctor] okay how about when you stand back up\n[patient] no pain\n[doctor] okay so no pain on extension some pain on flexion how about when i push right here on your back\n[patient] yeah that hurts\n[doctor] okay so some pain to palpation right around the l5 can i have that\n[patient] what happens when family members chime in like i'm doing right now because i actually think it was it hurts more when he stands up because i've watched him bend over but it's when he stands up that it really hurts\n[doctor] okay and and what's your relationship\n[patient] partners\n[doctor] okay so your partner is here with you today and reports that he is also having pain when you are standing up\n[patient] i've spent so many times you know who i am\n[doctor] so that's right you always come in together have you noticed anything else partner when when he is\n[patient] i'm worried about it because he is you know his pain tolerance is so high and he would n't be saying anything if it really was n't a problem because it's not at all like last week when he thought about raking leaves but did n't actually rake leaves but then his back did n't hurt as much but this time it really hurts\n[doctor] okay so you think this is more of a long term injury\n[patient] no he was just thinking about it hurting when he thought about raking but it did n't\n[doctor] okay alright and have you noticed any any prior pain with with the back\n[patient] i do n't want to take this away you better go back to talking to him\n[doctor] that's alright let's see how it turns out okay so how about if you if i push down on both your feet like this can you push back up on my hands\n[patient] can you repeat that\n[doctor] if i'm pushing down on your feet can you push push your feet back\n[patient] i\n[doctor] alright so your dorsiflexion is normal looks like pulses are equal in all extremities you said you had a little bit of a tingling sensation in which leg\n[patient] that would be my right leg\n[doctor] okay so some tingling in your right leg alright so i know that you had an x-ray when you came in because we always do x-rays when we have our patients come in of your low back and everything looks normal from that perspective so for your back pain sounds like you probably sprained your low back so i what i want you to do is let's rest it i'm going to prescribe some meloxicam have you taken that before\n[patient] i have not taken meloxicam\n[doctor] alright so i'll prescribe that i'm also gon na prescribe some physical therapy i know you said you have n't been overly active and your partner reported the same thing for a long time so we might wan na get you into some pt and hopefully get you back back in shape get you some stretches that you can do and some exercises and then you know if it's not improving i want you to send me a message and we can possibly look into see if there is anything else going on potentially an mri if it's still not improving does that sound like an okay plan\n[patient] it sounds reasonable\n[doctor] alright\n[patient] i think he should have an mri now i think he had surgery yesterday i think he should have an mri now this it's been hurting for like six hours now and she had an mri we are really worried about it\n[doctor] alright you know let's give it a couple of weeks and let's give it two weeks and then call me back and we'll get you an mri if it's still not improving\n[patient] good answer\n[doctor] alright alright

He is advised to monitor symptoms and contact the clinic if there is no improvement within two weeks or if symptoms worsen. The possibility of further imaging (MRI) will be considered if symptoms persist beyond this period. Bryan and his partner are counseled on the plan, and Bryan agrees to follow up accordingly.\n</response>\nThe reference note will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nCHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nLow back pain.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nBryan Brooks is a pleasant 39-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of low back pain. He is accompanied today by his partner.\n\nApproximately 2 hours after he finished raking leaves yesterday, the patient began to feel a tightening sensation in his low back and tingling in his right foot. Prior to this, he recalls a similar episode approximately 3 years ago in which his symptoms resolved after 1 day. Ice and Advil provided no relief, but his pain is less severe when he is in a seated position and taking a hot shower helped alleviate his pain. The patient's partner reports that his pain seems to worsen when he stands up.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nMusculoskeletal: Reports low back pain.\nNeurological: Reports tingling in the right foot.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nNEURO: Normal strength and sensation.\nMSK: Examination of the lumbar spine: No pain on extension. Some pain with flexion. Pain with palpation around L5. Dorsiflexion is normal. Pulses are equal in all extremities.\n\nRESULTS\n\nX-rays obtained and reviewed in office today were normal.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nLow back sprain.\n\nPLAN\n\nThe examination findings and x-ray results were discussed with the patient and his partner today. I recommend we treat this conservatively with rest, meloxicam, and formal physical therapy. If he fails to improve, we can consider obtaining an MRI for further evaluation.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nThe patient will follow up in 2 weeks.\n</gold_response>\nCarefully review the <response> based on the <conversation> and compare it to the <gold_response> when needed.\n\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Does the note provide correct clinical information based on the conversation?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the note include all important medical details from the conversation?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the note written clearly and organized in a standard clinical format for clinicians\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

tell me how you're doing how long have you had it what's going on with it\n[patient] sure so i've had it for about two months now and it's recently become red and is draining so i was concerned about how it's healed\n[doctor] okay and when you when you got it would you have any trauma to your foot or it just just did it pop up all of a sudden\n[patient] i think i may have gotten it from walking barefoot on the beach\n[doctor] okay alright and i saw you you did see your pcp before you came in did they put you on antibiotics\n[patient] they did start me on some medication but i did n't i did n't pick them up from the pharmacy yet\n[doctor] okay do you know which ones that they prescribed for you\n[patient] i do n't recall the name exactly\n[doctor] do n't recall alright\n[patient] something i had taken it before\n[doctor] okay so when you what beach did you go to when you you hurt it\n[patient] i'm sorry\n[doctor] so i was asking which beach did you did you go to when you hurt your foot\n[patient] at i was at dewey beach in my ambulance\n[doctor] dewey beach wow that sounds like fun i wish i could be a mab right now but all or as lucky as i guess as you are to go to dewey beach okay so does it hurt\n[patient] it sometimes it throbs does n't i do n't have specific pain but sometimes it does feel like there is some throbbing going on and again my my biggest concern is the it started to drain and it looks a little red\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] i have n't had that before\n[doctor] okay and that makes sense alright so as far as your diabetes you know and i think that's probably a a major cause of this not being able to heal how well are how well is that controlled\n[patient] i take my medication but i do n't check my sugar all the time\n[doctor] okay do you\n[patient] i'm not really sure how\n[doctor] okay do you know what your last a1c is i'm pretty sure you doc talk to you about it\n[patient] i think they told me it was around ten\n[doctor] around ten okay yeah that that's that's definitely pretty high yeah you definitely if your if your pcp has n't gotten created treatment plan for you definitely need to go back and see them so you can get that controlled alright so let me do a quick physical exam on your foot here today your vital signs look normal you do n't have a fever so let me just take a look at your foot so on your foot exam there is a one by two inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot so it's just proximal to the fifth mtp joint there is some redness some drainage present you have some edema around it there is fluid like you said that's coming out of it i do n't see any necrosis you do n't have any odor and i do n't appreciate any bony exposure so it pretty much is like you said it's it's red it's swollen i think you have an infection in there as well so when i touch it does that hurt\n[patient] no i i feel like increased pressure but it's not distinct\n[doctor] okay alright that's good so before you came in we did get an x-ray of your right foot and there is no evidence of osteomyelitis that means that luckily you do n't have a bone infection so that's great i think it's just in your skin so let's talk a little bit about your assessment and plan so you do have that diabetic foot ulcer and what i wan na do is i wan na order an abi ankle brachial index just to determine the blood supply in your foot to see if we can actually heal that ulcer i'm gon na also perform a debridement here just to take off some of that dead tissue and then i'm gon na prescribe you some clindamycin you can do that four hundred milligrams you take that for seven days take that twice a day just to try to get rid of that infection which you currently do have and that will get rid of some of that that redness and and drainage that that's happening right now did your doc did your pcp give you a surgical shoe something that you would wear while this is happening\n[patient] they did n't they mentioned that you may be able to give it to me\n[doctor] okay yeah we could definitely get you a a shoe because if you wear your regular shoes that pressure on that foot can really irritate it and take you backwards so i'll get you a shoe where you can wear that for the next month you know we just wan na make sure that it does heal and then i wan na see you back again in two weeks and we can we'll possibly do another debridement at that time we'll just take a look and see how the tissue is doing so how does that sound\n[patient] that sounds great\n[doctor] alright do you have any other question\n[patient] i do if anything happens in between\n[doctor] please feel free to call the office yeah please feel free to call you call the office we can definitely get you in you know if you are having any other issues and if it's an emergency if you feel like you're getting a fever feeling well please go to the urgent care or the er if you feel getting black or anything like that but

findings so i can put that into my record okay so your neck exam is fine there is no bruits your lungs are clear your heart exam is normal you do have a two over six systolic ejection murmur you had that in the past unchanged from before so that's not really worried about that your belly exam is good on your ankle exam on your left ankle you do have some tenderness over the lateral malleolus and you do also have some tenderness over this bone here which is the fifth metatarsal so i do n't see any there is some swelling there some redness but there is some pain with valgus stressing of your ankle as well and let me turn off my phone here and also you do have otherwise normal sensation normal pulses so on your so my diagnosis for your ankle is i think you probably have an ankle sprain but i would like to order an x-ray of your ankle because you do have some tenderness over this bone and i'm sometimes worried about a fracture so i'm gon na go ahead and get an x-ray i'm gon na put you in a splint we're gon na put you in a in an air splint and i'll give you some crutches until i get the x-ray back i want you to do just avoid weightbearing just to make sure there is no fracture there i will give you some naprosyn five hundred milligrams twice a day for pain control keep it elevated put some ice on it i think those are all good things and if the x-ray shows a fracture i'm gon na go ahead and give you a call back and we'll send you to orthopedics but right now let's try this air splint if there is no fracture i will probably have you take off the air splint and do some partial weightbearing and see how it goes does that sound like a reasonable plan for you\n[patient] that's a great plan i need to get back to exercising so\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] thank you\n[doctor] perfect and for the diabetes keep the eye appointment that you already have you know continue with the metformin i'm gon na order another hemoglobin a1c today we'll check some baseline labs as well

pcp and they referred me to you i i used to see a podiatrist and a couple of years ago but they moved and i was n't able to get another one\n[doctor] okay and how long have you had the wound\n[patient] about two to three weeks\n[doctor] okay have you had any kind of trauma to that foot\n[patient] no i bought a new pair of shoes to travel with and the neuropathy i guess i did n't feel that they were too tight at first it was just a blister but it looked a lot worse now i've been putting a band-aid on it and\n[doctor] okay and so did your doctor put you on any antibiotics when they they saw your foot\n[patient] yes i finished the course yesterday the wound looked about the same though\n[doctor] okay now does it hurt\n[patient] no i ca n't feel it\n[doctor] okay now have you had any other symptoms like fever chills drainage from the wound or anything along those lines\n[patient] no but when i take my sock off sometimes it sticks to the wound even when i put a band-aid on\n[doctor] okay well are you still wearing those same shoes that cause the problem\n[patient] no i'm upset\n[doctor] i'm so upset too i love those shoes\n[patient] no i'm so upset i i love those shoes\n[doctor] okay so what kind of shoes are they\n[patient] they're hoka's\n[doctor] ah so where did you get them\n[patient] i got them at rei couple of years ago\n[doctor] they're pretty good about helping you to fit your fit you in a shoe are n't they\n[patient] yeah\n[doctor] so what do you like about them\n[patient] they are comfortable they are easy to take on and off and they provide good stability\n[doctor] that's good so you've had some issues with stability sometimes or\n[patient] yes\n[doctor] okay okay well another question i want to ask you is how is your diabetes doing\n[patient] i do n't think it's too bad my last hgb a1c was a little over eight\n[doctor] okay alright well let me just do a quick physical exam okay for vital signs your temperature is ninety eight . one your vital signs look good your heart rate is seventy two respirations sixteen blood pressure is one ten over sixty five okay so on your foot exam let's see there is a one by two inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot it is just proximal to the right fifth to the fifth mtp joint and there is some yellow slough present with minimal granulation tissue there's no surrounding erythema or cellulitis and there's no evidence of fluid collection there's no necrosis there is no odor i do not appreciate any bony exposure on on vascular exam there are palpable bilateral femoral and popliteal pulses there are no palpable dp or pt pulses but doppler signs are present okay so does this hurt when i touch it here\n[patient] no it's okay\n[doctor] okay alright so i've reviewed the results your right foot x-ray that we did before you i came in the room and this shows no evidence of osteomyelitis which means there is no evidence of bone infection so that's really good so let me tell you a little about my assessment and plan for you so for your first problem your diabetic foot ulcer so i want to order an ankle brachial index abi to determine the blood supply to your foot to see if you can heal this wound i'm also gon na perform a debridement here in the office to take off some of the dead tissue and then next i'm going to prescribe a collagenase ointment to be applied to the wound once daily and then cover with a dry sterile dressing now we will continue this until we see the wound shrinking and a nice pink tissue is present and i want you to wear a surgical shoe to take pressure off of the area okay so i do n't think any more antibiotics are needed at this time and i want to see you again in two weeks so we may need to refer you to a vascular specialist if the abi indicates your blood supply is not optimal for wound healing okay\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] okay so for your diabetes it's gon na be very important to get your diabetes under control in order to get the wound to heal so we might even go ahead and get a diabetic consult so that we can go over some some maybe some ways you can modify your diet without a being too much but maybe that can bring down your hemoglobin a1c into a little bit better level okay\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] alright do you have any other questions\n[patient] no\n[doctor]

He was seen by his primary care physician who referred him to our office. His last visit with a podiatrist was 2 years ago, however they moved, and he has been unable to get another podiatrist. He denies any specific injury.\n\nThe patient purchased a new pair of shoes and was breaking them in prior to traveling. Initially, he did not feel that the shoes were too tight, however a blister formed on his right foot. The patient does have neuropathy and notes this might be why he did not notice the tightness. His blister soon became a wound and he was seen by his PCP. He was placed on a round of antibiotics, which he completed yesterday. He denies any changes to the appearance of the wound. The patient denies pain or drainage. His sock will occasionally stick to his wound, regardless of if he has a Band-Aid covering it. The patient has discontinued the use of these shoes. Occasionally, he has issues with stability, which was a primary purpose of purchasing these shoes. He denies any fever or chills.\n\nRegarding his diabetes, his last hemoglobin A1C was 8.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nConstitutional: Denies fever and chills.\nSkin: Reports right foot wound.\nNeurological: Reports neuropathy.\n\nVITALS\n\nTemperature: 98.1.\nHeart rate: 72.\nRespiration: 16.\nBlood pressure: 110/65 mm Hg.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nCV: Palpable bilateral femoral and popliteal pulses. No palpable DP or PT pulses but Doppler signs are present. No evidence of fluid collection.\nSKIN: On the right foot, there is a 1 x 2 inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot that is just proximal to the 5th MTP joint. There is some yellow slough present with minimal granulation tissue. No surrounding erythema or cellulitis. No necrosis. No odor.\n\nRESULTS\n\n3 views of the right foot were taken today. These reveal no evidence of osteomyelitis.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\n1. Right foot diabetic ulcer.\n2. Diabetes.\n\nPLAN\n\nAfter reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient regarding his current symptoms. I have explained to him that his x-rays did not reveal any evidence of osteomyelitis. At this time, I have recommended that we obtain an ankle brachial index ABI to determine the blood supply to his foot to see if he can heal this wound. I have also performed a debridement in the office to remove some of the dead tissue. I have prescribed a collagenase ointment to be applied to the wound 1 time daily and instructed him to cover with a dry sterile dressing. He will continue this until we see the wound shrinking and the nice pink tissue is present. I have also recommended that the patient be placed in a surgical shoe to take pressure off the area. I do not think that antibiotics are needed at this time. He may need to see a vascular specialist if the ABI indicates that his blood supply is not optimal for wound healing.\n\nRegarding his diabetes, I explained the need for controlling his diabetes and the effects this will have on wound healing. I have recommended a diabetic consultation to discuss diet modifications to bring his hemoglobin A1c to a better level.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nThe patient will follow up with me in 2 weeks to check on his progress.\n</gold_response>\nCarefully review the <response> based on the <conversation> and compare it to the <gold_response> when needed.\n\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Does the note provide correct clinical information based on the conversation?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the note include all important medical details from the conversation?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the note written clearly and organized in a standard clinical format for clinicians\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

The pain is localized to the lateral (outside) aspect of the knee and has persisted for one week. He reports minimal relief with Tylenol and has only elevated the knee without other interventions. William admits to a slight limp and some swelling and bruising on the lateral side of the knee but denies significant effusion. He has not attempted ice or heat therapy.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM:\nVital signs reveal elevated blood pressure (approximately 180/80 mmHg). Cardiovascular and respiratory exams are unremarkable with regular rate and rhythm and clear lungs. Examination of the right knee shows tenderness on the lateral side, slight ecchymosis, edema, and a small limp. Range of motion is limited but functional; the patient can bend the knee with some discomfort. No effusion is noted. Palpation elicits mild pain on the lateral aspect; medial side is non-tender. The patient can bear weight but exhibits a slight gait abnormality.\n\nRESULTS:\nRight knee X-ray shows no evidence of fracture or bony abnormalities. Blood pressure remains high despite patient adherence to medication. Blood glucose monitoring indicates some improvement, with measurements 4-5 times weekly. No recent blood pressure readings were obtained at home.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\n1. Right knee lateral ligament strain: Prescribe meloxicam 15 mg daily for pain and inflammation; refer to physical therapy for muscle strengthening and injury prevention. If symptoms persist, consider further imaging.\n2. Hypertension: Continue lisinopril 20 mg daily; order echocardiogram to evaluate cardiac function and assess blood pressure control; consider medication adjustment if target BP not achieved.\n3. Diabetes mellitus: Order HbA1c for long-term glycemic control assessment; review blood sugar logs; order lipid panel to evaluate cardiovascular risk and adjust therapy as needed.\nWilliam was advised on medication adherence and lifestyle modifications. Follow-up scheduled after imaging and lab results to reassess management.",

you have first so we know that you have hypertension right and i discussed maybe you getting a blood pressure cuff because i needed you to measure those a bit more regularly did you get the cuff\n[patient] what no\n[doctor] no okay that's fine have you measured your blood pressure recently at all\n[patient] no\n[doctor] okay are you still taking your medication because i see you're on twenty milligrams of lisinopril\n[patient] yeah most days i remember\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] ra i'm not suspicious but we're just gon na go with that okay because looking at your vitals it it is of still a bit high i'm not really comfortable i see like a hundred and eighty over you know eighty and\n[doctor] that's not where we wan na be so i wonder if we might need to adjust your medication but let's talk about your diabetes how are your blood sugars\n[patient] i think they're little bit better\n[doctor] okay what makes you think that have you been taking them\n[patient] yeah i check it you know most days again kinda when i remember\n[doctor] okay how often are you checking it\n[patient] i would say four five times a week\n[doctor] okay you might wan na switch to maybe two or three times a day but you know that's something i'm glad that you are measuring are you taking your metformin\n[patient] yes\n[doctor] okay and then i think we have you on five hundred milligrams correct\n[patient] yes\n[doctor] alright how is your diet\n[patient] kinda the same as my exercise decent could be better\n[doctor] alright and okay not a problem so what is your do you are you measuring your calories at all looking at your macros are you just eating what you feel like\n[patient] yeah just trying to watch what i eat more than anything but nothing specific\n[doctor] okay and are you do you know if you're particularly focused on your salt like is it like a low salt diet\n[patient] no just trying to watch my carbs a little bit more but not counting or anything\n[doctor] alright so like is it a specific diet i just wan na make sure like are you on like the keto diet\n[patient] no\n[doctor] okay alright not a problem so if you do n't mind i'm gon na go ahead and do a quick physical exam as i mentioned before your blood pressure is a little high as i listen to your heart i do like it's got a nice regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur when i listen to your lungs they sound clear bilaterally i would like to look at your knee though so when i press here on the outside does it hurt\n[patient] little bit\n[doctor] okay and then when i press on the inside does it hurt\n[patient] no\n[doctor] alright can you bend your knee and straighten it\n[patient] i can i think that's all i can i can bend\n[doctor] mm-hmm alright so are you having problems walking can you bear weight\n[patient] i can but i have a little bit of a limp\n[doctor] okay so do you mind getting up and walking for me really quickly alright so i do notice that there is a slight gait like there is a small sorry you are correcting you do have a limp i i am a little worried about that but it's probably it's probably the superficial when i'm looking at your knee i do notice some like ecchymosis and edema that just means bruising and swelling along the lateral aspect of your knee i do n't notice any effusion and it looks like you have a decent range of motion but i do understand that you know you are experiencing pain with some movement okay i'm gon na go ahead and order an x-ray and when you come back we can have that discussion alright so i reviewed the results of your right knee x-ray which showed no evidence of fracture or bony abnormality so let's talk about my assessment and plan alright so for your first problem of right knee pain i think you have a lateral a lateral ligament strain i wan na prescribe some meloxicam which is gon na be fifteen milligrams daily for pain and swelling i'm gon na refer you to physical therapy to help strengthen the muscles around the area and to prevent further injury if you're still having pain we can do further imaging imaging but like this is a common injury that tends to heal on its own for your second problem with hypertension i wan na continue the lisinopril at twenty milligrams and order an echo i am concerned that we might not be getting your blood pressure to where we need it to be so we might have to do some medication modification for your third problem with diabetes i wan na order an a1c i know that you said you have been measuring your blood sugars but i think this would give us a better image of what's been happening long term and i also wan na order a lipid panel in case we need to make any adjustments to that medication as well do you have any questions\n[patient] sounds good\n[doctor] alright awesome\n</conversation>\nThe generated note will be provided in these tags:\n<response>\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:\nWilliam reports injuring his right knee after visiting a trampoline park for the first time, hearing a snap and experiencing immediate pain upon landing. The pain is localized to the lateral (outside) aspect of the knee and has persisted for one week. He reports minimal relief with Tylenol and has only elevated the knee without other interventions. William admits to a slight limp and some swelling and bruising on the lateral side of the knee but denies significant effusion. He has not attempted ice or heat therapy.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM:\nVital signs reveal elevated blood pressure (approximately 180/80 mmHg). Cardiovascular and respiratory exams are unremarkable with regular rate and rhythm and clear lungs. Examination of the right knee shows tenderness on the lateral side, slight ecchymosis, edema, and a small limp. Range of motion is limited but functional; the patient can bend the knee with some discomfort. No effusion is noted. Palpation elicits mild pain on the lateral aspect; medial side is non-tender. The patient can bear weight but exhibits a slight gait abnormality.\n\nRESULTS:\nRight knee X-ray shows no evidence of fracture or bony abnormalities. Blood pressure remains high despite patient adherence to medication. Blood glucose monitoring indicates some improvement, with measurements 4-5 times weekly. No recent blood pressure readings were obtained at home.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\n1. Right knee lateral ligament strain: Prescribe meloxicam 15 mg daily for pain and inflammation; refer to physical therapy for muscle strengthening and injury prevention. If symptoms persist, consider further imaging.\n2. Hypertension: Continue lisinopril 20 mg daily; order echocardiogram to evaluate cardiac function and assess blood pressure control; consider medication adjustment if target BP not achieved.\n3. Diabetes mellitus: Order HbA1c for long-term glycemic control assessment; review blood sugar logs; order lipid panel to evaluate cardiovascular risk and adjust therapy as needed.\nWilliam was advised on medication adherence and lifestyle modifications. Follow-up scheduled after imaging and lab results to reassess management.\n</response>\nThe reference note will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nCHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nRight knee injury.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nWilliam Russell is a pleasant 57-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of a right knee injury. He has a past medical history significant for hypertension and type 2 diabetes.\n\nApproximately 1 week ago, the patient sustained an injury to his right knee while at a trampoline park. He explains that he was jumping on a trampoline when he heard a snap, followed by instant pain in the lateral aspect of his knee. This is not a common activity for him, and he admits that he is inconsistent with exercise. As far as treatment, he has been elevating his knee and taking Tylenol without significant relief of his pain. He has not tried applying heat or ice to the area.\n\nIn terms of his hypertension, the patient admits that he did not purchase a blood pressure cuff as previously recommended. While he does not monitor his blood pressures at home, he has been compliant with lisinopril 20 mg.\n\nHis diabetes appears to be stable based on home monitoring, although he is only checking his blood glucose levels 4 to 5 times per week. He does not follow any specific diet plan, but he does try to make healthier choices such as limiting his carbohydrate intake. He has also been taking his metformin 500 mg as prescribed.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nMusculoskeletal: Reports right knee pain.\n\nVITALS\n\nBlood pressure: 180/80 mmHg\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nCV: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs.\nRESPIRATORY:\nLungs are clear bilaterally.\nMSK: Examination of the right knee: Mild tenderness to palpation at the lateral aspect. Ecchymosis and edema along the lateral aspect. No effusion. Decent range of motion. Pain with movement.\n\nRESULTS\n\nX-rays of the right knee were obtained and reviewed. These reveal no evidence of fracture or bony abnormality.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\n1. Right knee pain, lateral ligament strain.\n2. Hypertension.\n3. Diabetes type 2.\n\nPLAN\n\nAfter reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, his symptoms appear to be consistent with a lateral ligament strain of the right knee. I am going to prescribe meloxicam 15 mg once daily for pain and swelling. I also put in a referral for physical therapy so he can work on strengthening the muscles around the area and prevent any further injury. We can consider further imaging if he continues to have pain, but I explained that this is a common injury that typically heals on it's own.\n\nFor his hypertension, I'm concerned that his blood pressure is not well controlled at this time, so we may need to modify his medication. I'm going to order an echocardiogram for further evaluation, but I want him to continue taking his lisinopril 20 mg for now.\n\nFor his diabetes, he stated that he has been measuring his blood glucose levels 4 to 5 times per week, but I want him to start measuring them 2 to 3 times per day. His hemoglobin A1c levels should provide more detail as far as his long-term progress so we will order that today. I'm also going to order a lipid panel and we can determine if any adjustments need to be made to his medication. In the meantime, he should continue taking metformin 500 mg.\n\n</gold_response>\nCarefully review the <response> based on the <conversation> and compare it to the <gold_response> when needed.\n\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Does the note provide correct clinical information based on the conversation?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the note include all important medical details from the conversation?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the note written clearly and organized in a standard clinical format for clinicians\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

He reports difficulty tying his shoes, sitting, and walking, with the pain being severe enough to cause him to be bedridden at times. The pain is localized to the lower back and radiates down the left leg, described as an electrical \"toothache\" that extends through the leg to the big toe. He rates his current pain as 6/10, with episodes reaching 13/10. The pain improves with lying down but worsens with standing, walking, coughing, or sneezing. He also reports weakness in both legs, foot dragging, and the use of a cane. He mentions a history of a fall from a roof 30 years ago, which previously caused back issues.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM:\nVital signs are stable. Back examination shows no bony abnormalities, redness, or bruising. Tenderness is noted at the L4 vertebra upon palpation. Flexion and extension of the back elicit pain. Motor strength is 4/5 in the left leg and 5/5 in the right leg; reflexes are brisk; sensory examination is intact in both lower extremities. No numbness or tingling is reported beyond the described weakness.\n\nRESULTS:\nMRI reveals a herniated disc at L4-L5 with associated nerve root impingement, consistent with the clinical presentation of radiculopathy.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\nThe patient has an acute L4-L5 disc herniation causing nerve root impingement, resulting in lower back and left leg radiculopathy. Given his history and MRI findings, treatment options include an epidural steroid injection to reduce inflammation and nerve compression. He has previously tried NSAIDs and physical therapy without relief. The plan is to proceed with the epidural steroid injection today, followed by referral to physical therapy for strengthening exercises. The patient is advised that full effect may take 2-3 weeks. He will be re-evaluated in approximately one month. The patient consents to the proposed treatment plan.",

today\n[patient] pretty good i'm feeling pretty good do n't like the weather you know i've been sitting in the waiting area for you know thirty minutes and that definitely makes the symptoms worse\n[doctor] okay well first of all i i agree with you the weather has kinda been all over the place been hot and been cold and and and now it seems like we've had a week of pretty chilly weather hopefully that changes pretty soon so tell me a little bit about when when your back pain started and and and what happened there\n[patient] well you wan na hear the long story or kind of the short story because my back has been bothering me for a long time\n[doctor] so let's do let's do the reader's digestive version\n[patient] well i ca n't i ca n't really tie my shoes you know standing really makes it bad you know when i go to the mall it really really i do n't know all i i've just been bedridden\n[doctor] okay and i know it got real bad about a month ago that's what the report here from the pcp said but can you tell me exactly where the pain is in your lower back can you kinda point to where that's at\n[patient] yeah it's right here and you know like thirty years ago when i fell off the roof it was really really bothersome they they said maybe there was a fracture or something and you know i do n't know i just could n't play football and then i had to you know kinda try to take care of myself but you know it's it's been really bad for about a month\n[doctor] okay and then do you still have that pain that radiates down your left leg sometimes\n[patient] yeah of course yeah it goes all the way through here\n[doctor] okay and then so it looks like you pointed to your lower back area and then pointed down through your hip and down into your to your left leg can you describe that pain for me\n[patient] it's like a electrical tooth ache and it it it goes down the whole leg\n[doctor] okay and can you rate that pain for me right now zero being none ten being the worst pain you've ever been in in your life\n[patient] right now it's less bad i did n't take my medications because i wanted you to see me as as i am but it's six out of ten but when it gets really bad i'd say it's thirteen out of ten\n[doctor] okay and anything that you do make it feel better you mentioned that you know sometimes sitting or laying down anything there make that better\n[patient] yeah like i said it the only thing that seems to make it better is laying down\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] you know standing walking seems to make it worse coughing sneezing makes it worse and you know i had a friend that saw you and you know you burned some nerves or something like that and so i was just seeing if there was something that you could do to get me out of this pain and hopefully you can do it today\n[doctor] okay and then any numbness or tingling in in your lower extremities or any weakness there in your legs\n[patient] you know it it's my back that's weak and my legs are weak both of them you know coughing sneezing seem to make it worse so sorry i'm just trying to be like a typical patient because most patients they do n't answer the darn questions so you you know all this time i still have n't gotten a chief complaint out of them so i love the way that you're trying to redirect and so you know what your doctor said you had back pain and leg pain but for me the most important thing for me to capture is that it's in the hip side of the leg side of the calf goes to the big toe and so i need them to be able to give me a perfect sort of root signature so i can hone in is that four five disk seen on the mri really significant or is it on the opposite side but again i'm sorry i'm purposely trying to be in a difficult patient because some of these patients he asked them fifty different questions they wo n't answer any of them so anyway sorry about well\n[doctor] that's okay\n[patient] to explain but this is what i deal with every single day\n[doctor] absolutely\n[patient] lot of pain yeah you know what my pain is eight out of ten it goes in the back goes into the hip side of the leg side of the calf goes to the big toe my foot kinda drags when i walk i've been having to use a cane nothing seems to make it better and but very few patients will give you the perfect history and most people will start talking about you know when something happened or go back to thirty years ago and you wan na redirect them to their current symptom but the patients wo n't rarely ever tell you what the chief complaint is you you got ta pull it out of them\n[doctor] so let's take a a quick look at you here okay let's do a physical exam real quick so your vitals look good which is a good thing now on your back exam i do n't see any bony abnormalities no redness or no and no bruising present now do you have pain when i press here\n[patient] no it's right here\n[doctor] okay so positive for pain to palpation at the l4 vertebrae and if you bend forward do you have pain there\n[patient] it hurts all the time especially sitting in these run office desks\n[doctor] okay so you are positive for pain with flexion and extension of your back i'm going to go ahead and test the strength of your legs now push out against my hands for me please\n[patient] okay that's it that's all i got\n[doctor] alright so four out of five strength in the left and five out of five on the right does look like that reflexes are brisk and motor and sensory is intact in both lower extremities i do wan na review the results of your mri the mri shows a disk herniation at the level of l4 l5 vertebrae and it is associated with some nerve root impingement and what that means is the nerve is being compressed by that herniation so let me tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan okay so for the diagnosis of of acute disk herniation at l4 l5 with that nerve root impingement that's causing that pain down your leg and your lower back pain now i know you've tried nsaids in the past without relief and you've done some pt so what i'm going to do is i'm gon na recommend an epidural steroid injection and we're gon na do that today for you if you agree to it what that means is gon na place some anti-inflammatory medication right at the spot of inflammation and once that's in place i wan na refer you back to pt and we wan na strengthen that area mkay you're young and otherwise healthy i think you'll do well but it can take about two to three weeks for that injection really to take full effect so then i want you to see pt and i want you to see me again in about a month are you okay with that treatment plan\n[patient] sure sounds good\n[doctor] alright sounds good i'm gon na have the nurse come in and get you prepped and then we'll get that injection for you\n</conversation>\nThe generated note will be provided in these tags:\n<response>\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:\nMatthew presents with a longstanding history of back pain, which has worsened over

The patient was referred from his primary care physician. The onset of his pain began 30 years ago, when he fell off of a roof. He endorses that it was very bothersome and he was unable to play football. He states that he was told that he may have a fracture at that time. The patient reports that his pain has worsened 1 month ago. He locates his pain to his lower back, which radiates into his left hip, down his left leg, on the side of his calf, and into his left big toe. The patient describes his pain as an \"electrical tooth ache\" that radiates down his entire left leg. He notes that he has to use a cane to walk as his left foot drags when he walks. He rates his pain level as a 6 to 8 out of 10, however it can get to a 13 out of 10 at its worst. He states that he did not take any medication before his appointment so it did not affect his pain during our visit. The patient notes that he was in the waiting room for 30 minutes today and states that it made his symptoms worse. His pain is aggravated by standing, ambulating, coughing, and sneezing. The patient states that he is unable to tie his shoes secondary to the pain. The patient states that his pain is alleviated by lying down. He also reports weakness in his bilateral legs and his back. The patient denies any numbness or tingling. The patient has attempted NSAIDs in the past without relief. He has also attended physical therapy.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nCONSTITUTIONAL: Vitals look good.\nMSK: Examination of the lumbar spine: No bony abnormalities. No redness. No bruising present. Pain with palpation at the L4 vertebrae. Positive for pain with flexion and extension of the back. 4/5 strength on the left, 5/5 strength on the right. Reflexes are brisk. Motor and sensory are intact throughout the bilateral lower extremities.\n\nRESULTS\n\nThe MRI of the lumbar spine was reviewed today. It revealed a disc herniation at the level of the L4-5 vertebrae. It is associated with some nerve root impingement.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nAcute disc herniation at L4-5 with nerve root impingement.\n\nPLAN\n\nI have recommended that we treat the patient conservatively with a epidural steroid injection and formal physical therapy.

all of all of the above\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] hypertension diabetes and also depression\n[doctor] okay and depression okay alright well let's go ahead and do a quick physical exam on you here i reviewed your vitals and everything there looks good so that's good and now on general appearance you appear in no distress and no jaundice on skin exam let me go ahead and listen to your heart here great on your heart exam you have a nice regular rate and rhythm with a two out of six six systolic murmur appreciate appreciated that's that has n't changed from last year so we will just continue to monitor that monitor that as well okay\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] alright now let me listen to your lungs here very good so your your lungs are clear with no wheezes rales or rhonchi and let me go

here great i i did n't see any gait disturbance and no edema so that's great so jacqueline i did review the results of your recent blood blood work and your hcv antibody test was positive and your liver panel that was done showing an elevated ast at thirty nine but your alt albumin and total bilirubin were all within normal limits so what that all means and let me go ahead and tell you about my assessment and plan here for your first problem of hepatitis c your initial labs are consistent with hepatitis c so based on the the once i just discussed with you there now hepatitis c is a viral infection that affects the liver so you most likely may have had it for years now so the next step that i would like to do is to confirm the diagnosis with some additional blood work that includes checking the hep c rna and also the hcv genotype okay now i would also like to determine the severity of your liver disease by checking for fibrosis of the liver and i'm gon na do this by ordering a special ultrasound and with this information i'm gon na be able to know how to proceed as far as treatment\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] alright now i know that was a lot of information do you have any questions for me\n[patient] yeah so should i be worried about my wife and my kids should they be tested as well\n[doctor] yes so we can start with the same screening that you have had for you for all of them first okay\n[patient] okay alright so i'll make sure i'll have them set up an appointment with our our family doctor\n[doctor] okay great so if you do n't have any other questions i'm gon na have the nurse check you out and get all that scheduled and i'm gon na see you in about three weeks\n[patient] alright perfect\n[doctor] alright\n[patient] thank you\n[doctor] take care

IV drug use (ceased over 15 years ago), reports recent blood work indicating hepatitis C infection. She has been feeling generally well but reports increased fatigue and tiredness at the end of the day despite adequate sleep. She denies jaundice, abdominal pain, or other symptoms. She has a history of alcohol consumption (~1 beer daily, slightly more on weekends) and smoking (currently 1-2 cigarettes daily, down from 1.5 packs). She reports no current medication or other significant medical conditions besides a family history of hypertension, diabetes, and depression.\n\n**PHYSICAL EXAM:**  \nVital signs reviewed; all within normal limits. General appearance is comfortable, no distress, no jaundice. Cardiac exam shows a regular rate and rhythm with a grade 2/6 systolic murmur, unchanged from previous exam. Lung auscultation reveals clear lungs without wheezes, rales, or rhonchi. Abdominal exam shows soft, non-tender abdomen with normal bowel sounds; no hepatosplenomegaly. Musculoskeletal exam is unremarkable with no gait disturbance or edema.\n\n**RESULTS:**  \nRecent blood tests show positive hepatitis C antibody, elevated AST (39), with normal ALT, albumin, and bilirubin. Liver ultrasound is pending to assess for fibrosis. The physical exam is otherwise unremarkable.\n\n**ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:**  \nJacqueline has confirmed hepatitis C infection, likely chronic given her history and lab findings. Additional testing with HCV RNA and genotype will be ordered to confirm active infection and guide treatment. Liver fibrosis assessment via ultrasound will be performed to evaluate disease severity. She was advised on the importance of screening her family members (spouse and children) for hepatitis C. She is encouraged to continue reducing alcohol and smoking. Follow-up is scheduled in three weeks to review test results and discuss treatment options.\n</response>\nThe reference note will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nCHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nHepatitis C.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nPatient reports personal history of intravenous drug use over 15 years ago.

going on with my headaches\n[patient] okay so i know you were sent here by your your pcp what was your understanding of why you were sent here\n[doctor] yeah so i actually have been someone who been struggling with headaches for years now ever since i was a teenager and they used to be around my when i would have my menstrual my menses but as i got older i noticed that it has been with that and also i can get it when i'm really stressed but recently and why i went to her is because my headaches have been getting a lot more they've just been happening a lot more frequently and a lot more severe\n[patient] okay can you tell me a little bit about them what how do they how do they feel when they come on\n[doctor] so they say mostly on my right side and it even seems like it's like behind my eye and it just like this pulsing like this really bad pulsing sensation\n[patient] okay do you notice these any activities or time of the day that makes them worse i know you said they they seem to get worse around your menstrual periods but is there any time of the day or that makes them worse\n[doctor] i i have noticed that you know i've been trying to exercise more in order to lose weight but i ca n't even really exercise for very long because i start of as soon as i start to jog i my headaches the headaches come back on a lot worse so i notice it when i'm exercising\n[patient] okay and do you seem to have any other symptoms when you get these headaches i've been having a ringing in my ears for a few months now and then what really scared me is that now i'm starting to get some blurred vision it's not all the time but it it will come and go but some blurred like on the\n[doctor] in my on the side of my vision\n[patient] okay okay and have you experienced any numbness or tingling to your hands or feet or your face\n[doctor] no i have n't\n[patient] okay so you you like to run a lot what kind of do you do you use a a good shoe you know what kind of shoes do you use for your running\n[doctor] yeah i yeah i i'm starting to get back into it i'm a big new balance person in asics so yeah those are the two brands i like to wear yeah so right now i'm using asics\n[patient] okay yeah i like to run too and i use nike\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] i used to get tumor guy but i i really kinda moved over to nike\n[doctor] hmmm\n[patient] that's good you know it is running is a great exercise\n[doctor] it is\n[patient] so have you had any let's get back to the exam here have you had a recent mri of your brain i saw one from a few years ago but as doctor white said anything about getting a more a recent mri\n[doctor] yeah she was gon na put one in but she wanted me to see you first and urgently so they have n't called me yet for the mri\n[patient] okay so that's good we i think we'll we will follow up with that mri but let's go ahead and take a do a quick physical exam here i reviewed your vitals that the the assistant collected when you came in and everything there looks good including your blood pressure you know with symptoms like that that's one of those things that i'd be concerned about\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] now on your heart exam it sounds like it's normal sinus rhythm with no murmurs rubs or gallops so that's good as i listen i'm gon na go ahead and look here in your eyes the funduscopic exam shows papilledema and that's just some of swelling behind there in the eye and this let me do a a neurological exam this will take a few minutes you get up to follow my instructions as we go through that okay on neurological exam your cranial nerves one through twelve are intact including a normal cranial reflex and just went to watch you walk across the room here\n[doctor] okay turn around come back and okay so on musculoskeletal exam your gait is normal\n[doctor] okay go ahead sorry\n[patient] that's okay for your first problem your headaches your symptoms are concerning for what we call idiopathic intracranial hypertension and this is a condition that that you have increased pressure in the in your head in your brain without any known cause for it now patient also presents with often present with symptoms such as yours you know headaches worsening with activity ringing in the ears changes in your vision so i'm i'm pretty confident that that's what we're having here now why we get concerned is if the pressure continues to increase this can lead to some permanent changes in your vision so i i do wan na get a a few more tests just so we can confirm that diagnosis and the first one that we just talked about is an mri i think it's really important to get that to check for any other condition that could be contributing to your symptoms now once i have that result i'm gon na be doing also doing a spinal tap which will help me evaluate the pressure in the brain and it can also help you feel better if you do have an increased pressure by taking the decreasing the amount of that pressure just by taking a a a little bit of fluid off of that and lastly i want you to be seen by a neuro-ophthalmologist for a complete eye exam now i i know that sounds like a lot of information but i think it's really important we get that accomplished do you have any questions for me\n[doctor] yeah that is a lot and so i i'm sure i'll have more that comes up but so let's say we do all this test and it confirms what you're saying does that mean was i referred to you because that means i will need surgery\n[patient] not necessarily if you have idiopathic intracranial hypertension there are number of medications that we can try to help decrease that pressure in your brain and this will also help you have less headaches when you exercise as exercise and weight loss are also an important part of the treatment\n[doctor] okay alright alright and i'll probably add something about so is this something i'll be doing soon is this all things i'll be doing this week\n[patient] yeah that's a great question here i i'm gon na go ahead and we're gon na for the mri i'll have to get a preapproval from your insurance company i will work on that my my my team in the front office will get that preapproved and then once that's done we'll call you to help schedule that mri\n[doctor] okay alright thank you bye\n[patient] bye sorry\n</conversation>\nThe generated note will be provided in these tags:\n<response>\nHISTORY OF PRESENT

He reports that the injury involved a rear-end collision, causing his neck and head to move rapidly forward (whiplash). The pain is rated as 7/10, intermittent but worsens with neck movement, especially with flexion, extension, and rotation. He describes the pain as localized to the back of the neck, with no radiation to the shoulders or upper back. He experienced some headaches early on, which have persisted. He has tried ibuprofen with minimal relief. No swelling, bruising, or neurological symptoms such as visual disturbances or hearing problems are reported. He did not seek emergency care post-accident.\n\n**PHYSICAL EXAM:**  \nTenderness to palpation over the soft tissues of the neck. Pain elicited with neck flexion, extension (worse), and lateral bending. Positive pain with rotation and inability to touch ears to shoulders. No tenderness or pain noted in the back or shoulders. No visible swelling or bruising observed.\n\n**RESULTS:**  \nNeck X-ray shows no fractures or bony abnormalities. No signs of bony injury or structural damage identified.\n\n**ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:**  \nThe patient is diagnosed with neck strain likely due to whiplash injury. Treatment will be conservative, including NSAIDs (Motrin 600 mg every 6-8 hours) and muscle relaxant (Flexeril 10 mg every 12 hours as needed). He is advised to minimize neck strain and rest appropriately. An MRI is ordered to rule out nerve impingement or other soft tissue injuries. Referral to physical therapy or chiropractic care is discussed; the patient expresses concern about chiropractic shaking, and alternative options are available. Follow-up will be scheduled after MRI results to determine further management.",

no just checking okay so if you do n't mind i'm gon na go ahead and do my physical exam so when i press on here on the side of your neck does it hurt\n[patient] yeah a little bit\n[doctor] okay positive pain to palpation of the soft tissues of the neck what about when i press on your back or your shoulders\n[patient] no that's fine\n[doctor] okay so when you flex your neck when you're touching your chin to your chest does that hurt\n[patient] mm-hmm\n[doctor] alright positive pain with flexion what about when you move it back\n[patient] yeah that hurts worse\n[doctor] okay okay

ear to your shoulders\n[patient] no\n[doctor] okay alright so positive pain on lateral bending wow this is pretty this is pretty serious not serious necessarily sorry about that so i reviewed the results of your x-ray but the results show no signs of fracture or bony abnormalities but let's go ahead and talk about my assessment and plan for you i believe what you have is something called neck strain for your neck pain i sorry treatments we are gon na go ahead and treat this a bit conservatively your i'm gon na put you on anti-inflammatories motrin six hundred milligrams and you're gon na take that every six to eight hours i also wan na give you a muscle relaxant called flexeril and it's gon na be ten milligrams and you'll take that every twelve hours as needed i'm gon na want you to try your best to to like relax your neck i'm sorry not to strain your neck anymore like to be conservative with how you move about and everything like that i also wan na order an mri just because you said you did n't go to the hospital or anything like that i just wan na make sure that you you're not suffering from like a concussion but this is something that's commonly referred to as like whiplash right your head just like it it just wiped essentially like back and forth to so severely and and that's probably what's causing your pain i think i wan na refer you to either physical rehab or a chiropractor once we get the results of the mri just to make sure that there is n't any impingement of like the nerves or anything like that do you have any questions\n[patient] i heard the chiropractors will shake they work\n[doctor] i do understand that some people have like reservations about going to the chiropractor but you know we do have some good ones that have like longstanding histories and patients that have had positive results from the experience but if you if you do n't like the idea of that we can consider other options like that rehab and physical therapy\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] alright any other questions\n[patient] no\n[doctor] alright thank you\n</conversation>\nThe generated note will be provided in these tags:\n<response>\n**HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:**  \nJack presents with neck pain following a motor vehicle accident one week ago. He reports that the injury involved a rear-end collision, causing his neck and head to move rapidly forward (whiplash). The pain is rated as 7/10, intermittent but worsens with neck movement, especially with flexion, extension, and rotation. He describes the pain as localized to the back of the neck, with no radiation to the shoulders or upper back. He experienced some headaches early on, which have persisted. He has tried ibuprofen with minimal relief. No swelling, bruising, or neurological symptoms such as visual disturbances or hearing problems are reported. He did not seek emergency care post-accident.\n\n**PHYSICAL EXAM:**  \nTenderness to palpation over the soft tissues of the neck. Pain elicited with neck flexion, extension (worse), and lateral bending. Positive pain with rotation and inability to touch ears to shoulders. No tenderness or pain noted in the back or shoulders. No visible swelling or bruising observed.\n\n**RESULTS:**  \nNeck X-ray shows no fractures or bony abnormalities. No signs of bony injury or structural damage identified.\n\n**ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:**  \nThe patient is diagnosed with neck strain likely due to whiplash injury. Treatment will be conservative, including NSAIDs (Motrin 600 mg every 6-8 hours) and muscle relaxant (Flexeril 10 mg every 12 hours as needed). He is advised to minimize neck strain and rest appropriately. An MRI is ordered to rule out nerve impingement or other soft tissue injuries. Referral to physical therapy or chiropractic care is discussed; the patient expresses concern about chiropractic shaking, and alternative options are available. Follow-up will be scheduled after MRI results to determine further management.\n</response>\nThe reference note will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nCHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nNeck pain\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nJack Torres is a pleasant 40-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of neck pain. The onset of his pain began 1 week ago after he was involved in a motor vehicle accident. He states that he was hit in the back and experienced whiplash. Following the accident he did not present to the emergency room and he does not recall having any swelling or bruising at the neck. He localizes his pain to the posterior aspect of his neck. His pain level is rated at 7 out of 10. When taking ibuprofen he states his pain improves to 5 out of 10. He finds that neck range of motion exacerbates his pain. Initially after the accident he reports that he experienced a couple of headaches, but he states he has not had any recently. He denies any hearing problems or visual disturbances.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nPatient reports that he played football years ago without any neck issues.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nEyes: Denies visual disturbances.\nHENT: Denies hearing loss.\nMusculoskeletal: Reports neck pain.\nNeurological: Denies headaches.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nNECK: No swelling noted\nMSK: Examination of the cervical spine: Positive pain to palpation of the soft tissues of the neck. Shoulders and back are nontender to palpation. Positive pain with flexion, rotation, and lateral bending. Severe pain with extension.\n\nRESULTS\n\n3 views of the cervical spine were taken. These reveal no evidence of any fractures or bony abnormalities.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nNeck strain.\n\nPLAN\n\nAfter reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. We discussed his x-rays did not reveal any signs of a fracture or bony abnormalities. Treatment options were discussed and conservative treatment has been recommended. He will begin taking Motrin 600 mg every 6 to 8 hours. A prescription for Flexeril 10 mg every 12 hours as needed was also provided. He was advised to be mindful of how he moves his neck and to be conservative to avoid straining his neck. I have also recommended that we obtain an MRI for further evaluation as the patient did not go to the emergency room following his accident. He will also be referred to either physical rehab or a chiropractor pending his MRI results.\n\n</gold_response>\nCarefully review the <response> based on the <conversation> and compare it to the <gold_response> when needed.\n\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Does the note provide correct clinical information based on the conversation?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the note include all important medical details from the conversation?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the note written clearly and organized in a standard clinical format for clinicians\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

left or some right shoulder pain that you've had for a few weeks now\n[patient] yeah it was i was doing some work in my backyard and a lot of different projects going on and you know i was obviously sore all over the next couple of days but my my right shoulder just keeps on bothering me and it keeps it's just really sore and it just has n't been going away\n[doctor] okay so have you had ever had any pain in that shoulder before\n[patient] a little bit i you know i i hurt that same shoulder because it's my my dominant hand my right hand i hurt it playing baseball when i was younger\n[doctor] mm-hmm\n[patient] so i've always had a little bit issues but this is it's does n't feel like it's in the rotator cuff it's it's kinda more on the outside and it's kinda like it's more tender on the outside when i raise my arm up so\n[doctor] okay yeah are you able to move your arm very well or not\n[patient] yeah there is no restriction with my arm it just i definitely feel some pain on the outside of it\n[doctor] okay and are you having pain all the time or just or does it come and go\n[patient] just whenever i move it if i'm sitting still i really do n't notice anything but whenever i move it then i can definitely feel some pain\n[doctor] okay how about at night is it bothering you at night also\n[patient] a little bit because i sleep on that side so\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] of course\n[doctor] okay and i may miss did you say what have you been taking for pain for that\n[patient] i just been taking some advil and then icing as much as i can so that's about it\n[doctor] okay and does that seem to help or\n[patient] a little bit yeah a little bit i mean it's it's still like you know sore to touch but it definitely dulls it a little bit\n[doctor] well sounds like you have quite a few projects going on what all what all are you doing for for your yard and\n[patient] i well let's see i've been putting an outdoor shower in we're extending our patio putting making some flower boxes putting down some you know for stone and all the flower beds so my wife's really put me to work i got a laundry lift\n[doctor] wow it sounds like a variety of projects but if you're putting down stone you're probably lifting those as well and then\n[patient] yeah\n[doctor] yeah i bet that is sore now tell me this have you experienced any numbness in your arm or your hands or\n[patient] no not really no numbness that i can think of\n[doctor] okay alright so see i'm gon na i'd like to do just a quick physical exam and i've reviewed your vitals those look good your no fever so that's good you're ninety seven . eight and your heart rate looks good at sixty two respirations sixteen your blood pressures one sixteen over eighty four that looks fine your oxygen saturation is real good at ninety nine percent so that all looks good so let's take a look at your left at your right shoulder so you have limited active and passive range of motion and there is some tenderness at the great tuberosity of the humerus there is no tenderness at the sternoclavicular or acro acromioclavicular joints you do have a good hand grip okay and on neurovascular exam of your right arm your capillary refill is less than three seconds and your sensation to touch is intact so i've reviewed the results of your shoulder x-ray and there is no fracture so that's good so let me tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan so for your first problem the left shoulder pain your symptoms are most likely due to this rotator cuff rotator cuff tendinopathy that means you that you injured injured the tendons of the muscles that help make your shoulder muscles i think we had to go ahead and order just an mri since you have had some problems before as well to make sure there's nothing else going on with it and i also want to refer you to physical therapy for approximately six to eight weeks and so during that time continue the tylenol and if your symptoms do n't improve we can go ahead and consider a steroid injection of your shoulder which could provide some relief do you have any questions about your plan\n[patient] no that sounds good\n[doctor] okay alright yeah a lot of patients it's very successful with the physical therapy so i really hope that will do it and so we'll just start there okay\n[patient] sounds great\n[doctor] okay thanks\n[patient] thanks\n[doctor] did you have any other any other problems any other injuries that that went along with this or\n[patient] my both my my feet are actually really sore too i obviously have been doing a lot of other yard work so you know it's kinda it's really stiff and stuff and they you know my ankle joints as well my wife seems to think that i do n't drink enough water so it could be something along that lines but i do n't know they're kinda this they just they're really sore and stuff so i've been trying to put them up and kinda put ice on them keep them elevated and it seems to be helping out a little bit but\n[doctor] yeah so if you do n't feel that you did anything to injure it we might start just maybe do some epsom salts have you tried soaking your feet in epsom salts that will tend to kinda pull out what's going on in there and just help your those muscles to relax and the soreness to to go away you might try that\n[patient] okay that sounds like a plan that

    "predicted_text": "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:\nMister Jackson, a 45-year-old male with a history of type 2 diabetes and mild intermittent asthma, presents with right elbow pain ongoing for approximately three weeks. He reports recent increased tennis activity, which he attributes as the likely cause. The pain is localized to the lateral aspect of the elbow, described as sharp, stabbing, and aching, with an intensity of 8/10 during activity and 3/10 at rest. The pain worsens with movement and is relieved by rest; over-the-counter analgesics (Tylenol and ibuprofen) and ice have provided minimal relief. No recent trauma, falls, or popping sensations are reported. No fever or systemic symptoms noted.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM:\nVital signs not specified. Cardiovascular exam reveals a grade 3/6 systolic ejection murmur, unchanged from prior. Musculoskeletal exam shows moderate tenderness at the lateral epicondyle of the right elbow, with pain on passive range of motion and mild pain with resisted wrist extension. No joint effusion palpable. Elbow movement elicits significant pain; pressing against the wrist causes mild discomfort. No other abnormalities noted.\n\nRESULTS:\nRight elbow X-ray demonstrates no acute fracture, malalignment, joint effusion, or bony abnormalities, indicating no acute bony pathology. Laboratory tests ordered include hemoglobin A1c, CBC, and chem-12; results pending.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\n1. Right lateral epicondylitis (tennis elbow) likely due to overuse. Management includes:\n   - Rest the right arm and avoid tennis for 4-6 weeks.\n   - Apply ice to the elbow for 20 minutes, at least three times daily.\n   - Use a forearm brace to reduce stress on the lateral epicondyle.\n   - Prescribe Ultram 50 mg once daily for pain relief.\n   - Follow-up in 4 weeks to reassess; consider additional imaging or physical therapy if no improvement.\n\n2. Type 2 diabetes mellitus:\n   - Blood sugars currently 150-160 mg/dL; likely influenced by recent increased carbohydrate intake.\n   - Increase metformin to 1000 mg twice daily.\n   - Advise blood glucose monitoring twice daily for two weeks.\n   - Order hemoglobin A1c, CBC, and chem-12 to evaluate glycemic control and overall health.\n\n3. Mild intermittent asthma:\n   - Remains well-controlled on Flovent and albuterol as needed.\n   - Refill albuterol prescription.\n\nAdditional notes:\n- Cardiac exam shows a stable systolic murmur; no change from prior.\n- No recent fever or systemic illness.\n- Patient advised to ease back into activity gradually and maintain regular follow-up.\n\nThe patient expressed understanding and is satisfied with the plan.",

amazing that was lot of fun to lot of fun did you catch it too\n[patient] i did\n[doctor] yeah\n[patient] yeah\n[doctor] yeah\n[patient] but that's it was i i could n't believe tiger went out there of course he did\n[doctor] right\n[patient] it was cool to see nothing\n[doctor] yep yep agreed agreed and so well listen we'll we'll hopefully get you feeling better here and get you back out on the court and out on the course and we'll talk about that but let's let me ask you about your diabetes a little bit a little bit here so how have your blood sugars been running mark have they been what in the low one hundreds two hundreds where are they\n[patient] they are like one fifty one sixty you know we just had easter and my kids got a whole bunch of candies so i keep eating that\n[doctor] hmmm okay yeah yeah understood so those cadboy eggs they'll get you every time too right\n[patient] yes\n[doctor] boy my gosh yeah those are the best so those are those are deadly do n't tell my cardiologist so okay so listen you know i see that we have you on metformin five hundred milligrams once a day no actually last visit we increased it so i've got you on metformin five hundred milligrams twice a day correct you're still taking that\n[patient] yes twice a day\n[doctor] okay and but your blood sugars are a bit off you know maybe those the cadberry eggs so how about your asthma how has that been doing you know have you had any asthma attacks you're still taking flovent twice a day and the albuterol as needed\n[patient] yeah knock on wood i my asthma is pretty much under control\n[doctor] okay excellent excellent alright and i recall you know just kinda review a few things i i think you've got an allergy to penicillin is that correct\n[patient] that's correct yes\n[doctor] okay and then you you know your surgical history you had your your gallbladder out what about ten years ago i think by doctor nelson correct\n[patient] yes that's right\n[doctor] okay and then let's go ahead and examine you alright so mark your exam is pretty much you know for the most part normal with a few exceptions on your heart exam you still have a grade three out of six systolic ejection murmur and that's unchanged from prior exam we're watching that and so that just means i hear some some heart sounds as your heart is beating there i'm not too concerned about it as as that's not changed otherwise normal cardiovascular exam and your physical exam otherwise on your musculoskeletal exam on your right elbow you do have moderate lateral epicondylar tenderness of the right elbow and how about when i move this when i move your elbow like this does that hurt you\n[patient] kills\n[doctor] okay sorry about that so you've got moderate pain with passive range of motion of the right elbow there is no palpable joint effusion and now what if i press against your wrist like so does that hurt you\n[patient] yeah it hurts a little bit\n[doctor] okay alright sorry so that's you have mild pain with resisted extension of the right wrist as well okay otherwise normal unremarkable exam and let's talk about your results now so your right elbow x-ray today shows no acute fracture or other bony abnormality so that's good there's no malalignment or sign of joint effusion and otherwise it's a normal right elbow x-ray so that's reassuring okay and hey you know i meant to ask you you know and do you have any history of fever recently you know along with the elbow pain you had noticed a fever\n[patient] no i do n't think so\n[doctor] okay great excellent alright so tell you what let's let's talk about my assessment and your plan here so for your first problem my assessment is is that you have acute lateral epicondylitis of your right elbow and this is also known as tennis elbow go figure right so this is due to overuse likely the increase in your your tennis activity which normally would be good but maybe we're overdoing it a little bit so i have a few recommendations i'd like you to rest your right arm as much as you can i want you to stop tennis for the next four to six weeks and please avoid repetitive stress in that right arm as well i want you to ice that right elbow for twenty minutes at least three times per day and this should reduce the pain and inflammation and then i'm also going to give you a brace for your right forearm and my nurse will give this to you before you leave that should help with the discomfort okay in that right elbow i will also write you a prescription for ultram and this should help with the pain i'll write you a prescription ultram fifty milligrams once per day that should help with your elbow pain so then i wan na see you in follow-up in four weeks and so we'll reevaluate your elbow at that time and if you we'll consider some additional imaging if needed possibly a physical therapy referral depending on how you're doing mkay now for your second problem of diabetes type two my assessment is is that your blood sugar is a little bit out of control mkay so we need to make some adjustments i'm going to increase your metformin to one thousand milligrams twice per day and i want you to check your blood sugar twice daily for the next two weeks and then let me know how your blood sugar is running and we can make some additional adjustments if needed but i will increase your metformin to one thousand milligrams twice a day now i'm going to also order a hemoglobin a1c level and and a cbc blood test today and and so we'll check those results the hemoglobin a1c and the cbc and then i'm going to also check a chem-12 blood test as well and now for your third problem of the mild acute intermittent asthma you my assessment is that it really remains under good control so let's keep you on that flovent and the albuterol no changes there and you can use those as tolerated it does look like you need a refill on your albuterol so i'm gon na write you a prescription for a refill of the albuterol and you can pick that up at your pharmacy as well so how does that all sound any questions for me\n[patient] it sounds pretty good i ca n't believe it's just tennis elbow feel like a looser coming in here but it's okay i get it\n[doctor] yeah yeah well\n[patient] i'm not i'm not young anymore\n[doctor] yeah well let's let's keep you active but take a break for a bit and let's ease back into it okay so it's great to see you and i'll see you back in four weeks let me know if you have other problems in the meantime\n[patient] okay\n</conversation>\nThe generated note will be provided in these tags:\n<response>\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:\nMister Jackson, a 45-year-old male with a history of type 2 diabetes and mild intermittent asthma, presents with right elbow pain ongoing for approximately three weeks. He reports recent increased tennis activity, which he attributes as the likely cause. The pain is localized to the lateral aspect of the elbow, described as sharp, stabbing, and aching, with an intensity of 8/10 during activity and 3/10 at rest. The pain worsens with movement and is relieved by rest; over-the-counter analgesics (Tylenol and ibuprofen) and ice have provided minimal relief. No recent trauma, falls, or popping sensations are reported. No fever or systemic symptoms noted.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM:\nVital signs not specified. Cardiovascular exam reveals a grade 3/6 systolic ejection murmur, unchanged from prior. Musculoskeletal exam shows moderate tenderness at the lateral epicondyle of the right elbow, with pain on passive range of motion and mild pain with resisted wrist extension. No joint effusion palpable. Elbow movement elicits significant pain; pressing against the wrist causes mild discomfort. No other abnormalities noted.\n\nRESULTS:\nRight elbow X-ray demonstrates no acute fracture, malalignment, joint effusion, or bony abnormalities, indicating no acute bony pathology. Laboratory tests ordered include hemoglobin A1c, CBC, and chem-12; results pending.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\n1. Right lateral epicondylitis (tennis elbow) likely due to overuse. Management includes:\n   - Rest the right arm and avoid tennis for 4-6 weeks.\n   - Apply ice to the elbow for 20 minutes, at least three times daily.\n   - Use a forearm brace to reduce stress on the lateral epicondyle.\n   - Prescribe Ultram 50 mg once daily for pain relief.\n   - Follow-up in 4 weeks to reassess; consider additional imaging or physical therapy if no improvement.\n\n2. Type 2 diabetes mellitus:\n   - Blood sugars currently 150-160 mg/dL; likely influenced by recent increased carbohydrate intake.\n   - Increase metformin to 1000 mg twice daily.\n   - Advise blood glucose monitoring twice daily for two weeks.\n   - Order hemoglobin A1c, CBC, and chem-12 to evaluate glycemic control and overall health.\n\n3. Mild intermittent asthma:\n   - Remains well-controlled on Flovent and albuterol as needed.\n   - Refill albuterol prescription.\n\nAdditional notes:\n- Cardiac exam shows a stable systolic murmur; no change from prior.\n- No recent fever or systemic illness.\n- Patient advised to ease back into activity gradually and maintain regular follow-up.\n\nThe patient expressed understanding and is satisfied with the plan.\n</response>\nThe reference note will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nCHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nRight elbow pain.\n\nMEDICAL HISTORY\n\nPatient reports history of type 2 diabetes and mild intermittent asthma.\n\nSURGICAL HISTORY\n\nPatient reports history of cholecystectomy 10 years ago by Dr. Nelson.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nPatient reports he has been playing tennis since high school.\n\nALLERGIES\n\nPatient reports that he has an allergy to PENICILLIN.\n\nMEDICATIONS\n\nPatient reports taking metformin 500 mg twice a day, Flovent twice a day and albuterol as needed.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nConstitutional: Denies fever.\nMusculoskeletal: Reports right elbow pain.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nCardiovascular\n- Auscultation of Heart: Grade 3 out of 6 systolic ejection murmur, unchanged from prior exam.\n\nMusculoskeletal\n- Examination of the right upper extremity: Moderate lateral epicondylar tenderness. Moderate pain with passive range of motion. No palpable joint effusion. Mild pain with resisted extension of the right wrist.\n\nRESULTS\n\nX-ray of the right elbow taken today is reviewed and shows no acute fracture or other bony abnormality. There is no malalignment or joint effusion. Otherwise normal right elbow x-ray.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN\n\n1. Acute lateral epicondylitis of right elbow.\n- Medical Reasoning: Patient presents today with symptoms consistent with lateral epicondylitis secondary to overuse.\n- Patient Education and Counseling: The nature of the diagnosis was discussed. He was advised that this is like due to increased tennis activity and was encouraged to rest as much as possible. - Medical Treatment: Patient will discontinue playing tennis for the next 4 to 6 weeks, as well as avoid repetitive stress with the right arm.

    "predicted_text": "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:\nAngela presents for follow-up and evaluation of recurrent kidney stones. She reports that her recent kidney stone, which caused pain last week, has passed approximately three days ago, with no current hematuria or pain. She has a history of multiple kidney stones (estimated 7-8 episodes). She also reports a history of hypertension and diabetes, with generally well-controlled blood pressure and blood sugars. She mentions occasional insomnia managed with meditation and sleep hygiene practices. No current chest or abdominal pain.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM:\nVital signs: BP 150/90 mmHg; physical exam shows no abdominal tenderness or CVA tenderness. Lung auscultation is clear bilaterally. Cardiac exam reveals a grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur, unchanged from previous exams. No other abnormalities noted.\n\nRESULTS:\nRecent labs include an A1c of 6.7%, indicating slight improvement in glycemic control. Urinalysis and urine culture are pending to assess for residual infection or other abnormalities. Blood pressure readings at home are typically 130-140/60-70 mmHg, suggesting effective antihypertensive management with Norvasc.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\n1. Recurrent kidney stones: Likely passed this episode; however, due to ongoing stone formation risk, a referral to urology (Dr. Harris) will be made for further evaluation. Labs including urinalysis and urine culture will be obtained to rule out infection or metabolic causes.\n2. Hypertension: Well-controlled on 2.5 mg Norvasc; no medication changes needed. Continue current regimen. Reinforce adherence and blood pressure monitoring.\n3. Diabetes: On 500 mg metformin daily; A1c decreased to 6.7%. Continue metformin. Advise patient to check blood sugars before meals to monitor control.\n4. Insomnia: Managed with sleep hygiene and meditation; prescribed 10 mg melatonin as needed. Encourage continued sleep hygiene practices, including reducing electronics before bed.\n5. Dietary counseling: Discussed sodium intake reduction and potential referral to nutritionist to assist with dietary modifications, especially regarding fast food consumption.\nFollow-up in three months for reassessment of kidney stones, blood pressure, and diabetes management.",

it says you're you're here you think you have a kidney stone you had some in the past so we're gon na take a look at that and then you also have a past medical history of hypertension and diabetes we want to take a look at those as well so first thing what's going on with your kidneys you as what how long ago have you been feeling pain and and how's all that\n[patient] pain's been up and down i went to the emergency room last week but now i think i'm doing a little bit better\n[doctor] okay so the case of kidney stones so have you had you said you've had them in the past and how often would you say\n[patient] i do n't know i this is probably like my seventh or eighth kidney stone\n[doctor] seven or eight kidney stones so do you think you passed it yet or is it still in the\n[patient] i think this one passed yeah\n[doctor] this one passed how long would you say it took to\n[patient] well i went last week and then i think it passed about three days ago\n[doctor] okay so are you still noticing any blood in your urine\n[patient] no no more blood\n[doctor] alright are you still having pain\n[patient] nope\n[doctor] yeah\n[patient] the pain's gone\n[doctor] okay that that's that's

was percocet\n[doctor] okay well that's good i'm very glad to see that you were able to pass that stone have you seen a urologist before about this\n[patient] i have n't seen one in a while but yes i saw someone maybe a year ago\n[doctor] okay so yeah i know you keep having these recurrent kidney stones so i definitely think we can get you a referral to urology just to check up on that and also wan na do some labs as well\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] so i also see you're here for you have a past medical history of of hypertension and when you came in today your blood pressure was a little bit high it was a one fifty over ninety i'm reading here in your chart you're on two point five of norvasc\n[patient] hmmm\n[doctor] now have you been taking that regularly\n[patient] i have but at home my blood pressure is always great\n[doctor] okay maybe you have a little white coat syndrome some of my patients do have it i have it myself and i'm a provider so i definitely understand yeah i know we we talked about last time you getting a blood pressure cuff and taking those about two to three times a week so what have those readings been i'm usually like one thirty to one forty over sixty to seventy\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] that's that's that's not too bad i think when you first came in you were around like one eighty so it seems to be that that norvasc is is working for you how about your diet i know you were having a little issue eating some fast food and and cakes and cookies and have you been able to get that under control\n[patient] yeah it's hard to give up the fast food altogether because it's a lot of on the go you know\n[doctor] okay so do you think you would be able to get that under control by yourself or would you do you think you would need help with that maybe a dietitian be able to help you out\n[patient] yeah i do n't know i do n't know if i can make another appointment i just add to the extra\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] less time to make food so\n[doctor] yeah yeah definitely understand\n[patient] mm-hmm\n[doctor] alright yeah so i mean that's one thing we just got ta work one is your diet we try to keep you at least just twenty three hundred milligrams or less of sodium per day i know that's hard for a lot of salads and stuff i know it's hard for lot of people especially with all like the the prepackage foods we have around today so that's definitely something we we should work on\n[patient] mm-hmm\n[doctor] so let's also look here you have a history of diabetes and so you're on that five hundred milligrams of metformin daily now have you been taking that as well\n[patient] yeah i take my metformin\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] yeah\n[doctor] so what have your blood sugars been running daily\n[patient] well i do n't check it very often\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] but i think they've been pretty good\n[doctor] okay so i'm looking here i think last after your last visit you got a1c now was six . seven so it's a little bit high it's gone down a little bit since you were first diagnosed with the type two diabetes a year ago so i'm glad we're making progress with that as well alright so i'm just gon na do a quick physical exam on you before i do just wan na make sure are you having any chest pain today\n[patient] no\n[doctor] alright any any belly pain\n[patient] no\n[doctor] alright so i'm gon na listen to your lungs your lungs are clear bilaterally i do n't hear any crackles listen to your heart so on your heart exam i do hear that grade two out of six systolic ejection murmur and we already knew about that previously so it has n't gotten any worse so that's good so i'm gon na just press here in your abdomen because that you did have those kidney stones does that hurt\n[patient] no\n[doctor] alright i'm gon na press here on your back\n[patient] no pain\n[doctor] okay so on your abdomen exam of your abdomen i'm showing no tenderness to palpation of the abdomen or tenderness of the the cva either on the right side so that that's good i think that's pretty much cleared up so let's we'll talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you and so my assessment you you did have the those kidney stones but i i think they are passed this time but i do want to get a couple of labs so we'll get a urinalysis\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] alright we'll get a urine culture just to make sure everything is is cleared up i also want to give you a referral to referral referral to urology\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] because you do keep having these all the time and so maybe there's something else going wrong and so they can help get that under control\n[patient] can i see doctor harris\n[doctor] of course yeah we can we can get you that road to doctor harris and\n[patient] he's not like\n[doctor] he's great he's he's he he he's great i've heard he does really good work so that'll be good so for the hypertension you seem to be doing well on the two . five of norvasc so we are not gon na make any changes to that do you need any refills right now\n[patient] no usually the pharmacy just sends them through when i call\n[doctor] okay great so we we wo n't we gave you refills with that i do wan na give you a consult to nutrition\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] just to help you with that diet\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] because i think that's a major factor of us eventually getting you off of all medications\n[patient] hmmm\n[doctor] and then for your diabetes i'm just keep you on that on that five hundred of metformin okay i think you're doing well with that as well also but i do want you to

follow-up and evaluation of recurrent kidney stones. She reports that her recent kidney stone, which caused pain last week, has passed approximately three days ago, with no current hematuria or pain. She has a history of multiple kidney stones (estimated 7-8 episodes). She also reports a history of hypertension and diabetes, with generally well-controlled blood pressure and blood sugars. She mentions occasional insomnia managed with meditation and sleep hygiene practices. No current chest or abdominal pain.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM:\nVital signs: BP 150/90 mmHg; physical exam shows no abdominal tenderness or CVA tenderness. Lung auscultation is clear bilaterally. Cardiac exam reveals a grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur, unchanged from previous exams. No other abnormalities noted.\n\nRESULTS:\nRecent labs include an A1c of 6.7%, indicating slight improvement in glycemic control. Urinalysis and urine culture are pending to assess for residual infection or other abnormalities. Blood pressure readings at home are typically 130-140/60-70 mmHg, suggesting effective antihypertensive management with Norvasc.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\n1. Recurrent kidney stones: Likely passed this episode; however, due to ongoing stone formation risk, a referral to urology (Dr. Harris) will be made for further evaluation. Labs including urinalysis and urine culture will be obtained to rule out infection or metabolic causes.\n2. Hypertension: Well-controlled on 2.5 mg Norvasc; no medication changes needed. Continue current regimen. Reinforce adherence and blood pressure monitoring.\n3. Diabetes: On 500 mg metformin daily; A1c decreased to 6.7%. Continue metformin. Advise patient to check blood sugars before meals to monitor control.\n4. Insomnia: Managed with sleep hygiene and meditation; prescribed 10 mg melatonin as needed. Encourage continued sleep hygiene practices, including reducing electronics before bed.\n5. Dietary counseling: Discussed sodium intake reduction and potential referral to nutritionist to assist with dietary modifications, especially regarding fast food consumption.\nFollow-up in three months for reassessment of kidney stones, blood pressure, and diabetes management.\n</response>\nThe reference note will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nCHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nKidney stone.\n\nMEDICAL HISTORY\n\nPatient reports history of hypertension, diabetes, and kidney stones.\n\nMEDICATIONS\n\nPatient reports taking Norvasc 2.5 mg and metformin 500 mg.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nConstitutional: Reports insomnia.\nCardiovascular: Denies chest pain.\nGastrointestinal: Denies abdominal pain.\nGenitourinary: Denies hematuria.\n\nVITALS\n\nBlood pressure: 150/90 mm Hg\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nRespiratory\n- Auscultation of Lungs: Clear bilaterally.

these tags:\n<conversation>\nDoctor-patient dialogue:\n\n[doctor] hey betty how are you doing\n[patient] i'm doing okay i just been really frustrated because with my asthma and it just seems like i can never catch a break never get better i'm always it seems like i'm always coughing and wheezing\n[doctor] i'm sorry to hear that what normally triggers your asthma type symptoms\n[patient] i find that it's really really when i get sick if i get sick with a cold i almost always know that my asthma is going to flare i did notice one time though that when i went to my aunt's house i i had a flare afterwards and i think it's because of her cat so i try to avoid going there and i have n't really had an issue since\n[doctor] okay so now you mentioned that that happens somewhat a lot how frequently does this occur that you have these breathing type problems\n[patient] it seems like it happens really every month or every other month for the past six months i usually end up going to the urgent care a lot and get or my primary care doctor and so sometimes they'll give me antibiotics sometimes i'll get steroids one time it was so bad i actually ended up going to the emergency department\n[doctor] wow that that can be a little bit scary so you mentioned that your primary care provider or the urgent care provider gave you medications what medications are you using for your asthma right now\n[patient] i have two inhalers one but i really just use one of them it's a blue one that seems like the only inhaler that helps me the other one when i when i try to use it it does n't work\n[doctor] okay so do you think that's the albuterol inhaler is it do you remember the name like ventolin or\n[patient] yes yes that's the name of it\n[doctor] is that it okay alright and then how often do you feel like you need to use that\n[patient] i would say like almost everyday i feel like i'm using my inhaler because i'm always coughing and wheezing and a couple of times a night i'll wake up as a couple times a week i'll end up waking up needing to use my inhaler as well\n[doctor] okay and then when you use it at that time does it help\n[patient] it does\n[doctor] okay and how many walk me through how you use that you just wake up and you take one puff or is it two puffs\n[patient] yeah i take i usually take two puffs\n[doctor] okay but then you get enough relief that you can go back to sleep\n[patient] yeah for the most part\n[doctor] okay now have you ever needed to be hospitalized due to your asthma symptoms you mentioned you've had to go to the er\n[patient] yeah for only once i can think of when i was young i think like around eight years old i had to be hospitalized but nothing since then\n[doctor] okay i do wan na take a little bit of a a deeper dive here into your er and urgent care visits can you tell me a little bit more about those\n[patient] yeah i feel like i've had several i do n't remember the exact number but i've had several this past year they almost always have to start me on prednisone\n[doctor] okay like a prednisone taper pack that type of thing\n[patient] yeah yeah sometimes they'll just give me like like a like a large dose over five days\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] and then sometimes they make me take less and less and less so the over like nine or ten days\n[doctor] okay so both the dosepak and then also the high dose as well okay\n[patient] yeah\n[doctor] and then when was your last exacerbation\n[patient] probably about a month ago\n[doctor] okay so just out of curiosity you mentioned that you you have trouble when you go over to your aunt's house because of your cat now i see here that you really like to go outside and walk and do those type of things do you have any other type of issues whenever you you go outside any any seasonal allergies or anything like that\n[patient] no not really\n[doctor] okay so you do n't have any history of seasonal allergies which is good so it looks like here that you put down that you enjoyed hiking so you do n't have any trouble getting out and going hiking and and have you tried the new trails there behind behind the wreck center\n[patient] yeah i'm really excited to i mean i have to be careful because i you know with my coughing my wheezing but i'm really i'm looking forward to getting better so i can really start hiking again\n[doctor] okay now i really need you to be truthful when you answer these next questions this is important for taking a good history do you smoke any type of cigarette or tobacco product and have you ever smoked or do you smoke marijuana on a regular basis\n[patient] no i've never smoked and i do n't vape either or yeah i do n't smoke cigarettes or marijuana\n[doctor] okay and then you said you do n't vape so no vaping or e-cigarette use at all\n[patient] hmmm hmmm\n[doctor] okay and then are you routinely in an area where there is a lot of airborne particular like smoking in bars or around any type of of you know like race tracks or anything like that\n[patient] sometimes i go to the bars with some friends and yeah the smoking does irritate me\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] so i do n't try to go there often\n[doctor] okay thank you for sharing that with me so if it's okay with you i'd like to go ahead and do a quick physical exam\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] now i reviewed your vitals for today and your your blood pressure is good it's one twenty eight over eighty two your respiratory rate is sixteen and your oxygen saturation is ninety nine percent on room air which is a good thing i'm gon na take a listen to your heart here your heart is regular rate and rhythm and i do n't appreciate any ectopic beats or and i do n't hear anything like rubs murmurs or gallops which is good so i'm gon na go take and listen to your lungs here on your lung exam i do appreciate some diminished lung sounds throughout with the occasional slight expiratory wheeze and that's bilaterally so i hear that on both sides i'm gon na go do a quick neck exam here neck is supple trachea is midline i do n't appreciate any lymphadenopathy taking a listen here i do n't appreciate any carotid bruit now i'm also gon na take a look at your hands here i note strong bilateral pulses i do n't appreciate any clubbing on any of your fingertips which is which is important and i also note brisk capillary refill i'm gon na go ahead and review the results of your pulmonary function test that i had you do when you came into the office today and reviewing those results i do see that they are consistent with somebody who would be diagnosed with asthma so lem me go ahead and tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan so now for your first problem of asthma your symptoms are consistent with moderate to intermediate or i'm sorry moderate moderate intermittent asthma and it's gon na be really important for us to be consistent with your inhaled inhaled steroid inhaler so i'm gon na need you to take that as prescribed and that's really gon na help cut down on those daily symptoms and needing to use that rescue inhaler that albuterol inhaler as frequently so the more you take and more consistently you take your inhaled steroid inhaler the less you will use your albuterol now it's not a fast acting inhaler like your albuterol but what is important is as going to be what helps you long term now if you do have an acute exacerbation so if you're having an acute issue with your breathing i do want you to continue to use your albuterol inhaler one to two puffs and then i want you to wait and see how your breathing is before you would take an additional one to two puffs we hope you have less of those acute exacerbations as you continue to use your inhaled steroid i'm also going to put together an asthma action plan for you and that's gon na help us look at your symptoms see where your your pain points can be you know like those being having issues with with cats or dust that type of thing and we'll work on how to handle those symptoms through that asthma action plan so do you have any questions comments or concerns otherwise i will see you in thirty days\n[patient] alright thank you\n[doctor] you're welcome\n[doctor] so let me tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan for your first problem of asthma your symptoms are consistent with moderate intermittent asthma i'm gon na start you on flovent one hundred ten micrograms one puff twice per day that's gon na be important for you to be consistent with your inhaled steroid inhaler this is gon na help prevent those daily symptoms and from needing for you to use your albuterol inhaler or that rescue inhaler less frequently you can continue using your ventolin inhaler and that would be two puffs every four to six hours p.r.n . i'm also gon na put together an asthma action plan for you so we know what to do based on your symptoms i'd like to see you again in a month or sooner if you have any worsening symptoms does that sound okay\n[patient] it does thank you\n[doctor] you're welcome i'll see you in a month\n[patient] alright thanks\n</conversation>\nThe generated note will be provided in these tags:\n<response>\nHISTORY OF PRESENT

The pain is described as sharp and stabbing, radiating down to the right leg and toes, particularly the big toe. He reports difficulty getting comfortable, especially when sitting, and experiences numbness and tingling in the right leg and foot. He denies any loss of sensation in the genital or rectal area, weakness, or bladder/bowel control issues. Past interventions include physical therapy, temporary pain medications, and consideration of surgery, which he wishes to avoid. The pain has limited his activity, including golf, and has contributed to weight gain.\n\n**PHYSICAL EXAM:**  \nVitals are stable. Musculoskeletal exam shows no erythema or bruising but reveals midline tenderness at L4-L5 and right-sided lumbar paravertebral tenderness. Lumbar flexion is painful. Straight leg test is positive on the right. Neurological exam indicates decreased light touch sensation in the right lateral thigh at the L4 dermatome; patellar and Achilles reflexes are symmetrical. No signs of weakness or loss of sensation in the genital or rectal area.\n\n**RESULTS:**  \nMRI demonstrates a disk herniation at L4-L5 with nerve impingement, consistent with radiculopathy.\n\n**ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:**  \nLarry has chronic lumbar back pain due to an L4-L5 herniated disk causing nerve impingement and radiculopathy. The plan includes a lumbar epidural corticosteroid injection under fluoroscopy to reduce inflammation and alleviate symptoms. The patient is informed about the procedure, its frequency (not exceeding four times per year), and the expected quick recovery. The first injection will be scheduled today if agreeable. Follow-up will assess response to treatment.",

i've been having for a couple of years now\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] and i have tried so many things and just nothing seems to work\n[doctor] i'm sorry to hear that now do you remember what caused the pain initially\n[patient] you know i never fell or was in an accident but i do remember it all happened like i started having back pain after i was moving furniture one weekend\n[doctor] okay and now can you describe the pain for me\n[patient] yeah it feels like a sharp stabbing pain in my back and it does go down even down to my right leg sometimes all the way down to my toe it feels like my big toe\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] and i also feel like i just ca n't get comfortable which is worse when i sit down okay yeah\n[doctor] okay now with that do you have any numbness or tingling associated with your back pain\n[patient] yeah i do get some numbness and tingling especially to my right leg that goes down to my foot\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] let me separate these\n[doctor] and how about a loss of sensation in the genital or the rectal area\n[patient] no nothing like that\n[doctor] okay now do you have any weakness\n[patient] i would n't say i have any weakness no\n[doctor] okay do you experience like any loss of control of your bladder or your bowels\n[patient] no\n[doctor] okay now you mentioned earlier that you you have some tried tried some things in the past so tell me what were they\n[patient] so i've tried some physical therapy before and so when it gets really bad they've even had to prescribe some strong pain medications for me but that was only temporary and they even mentioned surgery to me in the past but i really would like to avoid surgery\n[doctor] okay sure so tell me what is your day like\n[patient] my day so i try to be as active as i can but of course it's been difficult with my back pain and so because of that i have gained some weight over the past years\n[doctor] okay alright well i'm sorry to hear that i know that you used to like playing golf\n[patient] yeah i and you know golf is relatively new for me i've been trying to get into it but this has definitely set me back\n[doctor] yeah i'm sorry yep probably now at the peak of you know just learning it and being able to do more with it this comes and this happens right\n[patient] exactly\n[doctor] well let's see what we can do for you here so you can go out into the you know the golf course again now do you tell me do you have any family members with spine conditions\n[patient] no i ca n't recall any family members\n[doctor] okay alright and do you smoke\n[patient] not now i i quit about twenty years ago\n[doctor] okay alright well alright well i like to do a quick physical exam on you here\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] i'm gon na go ahead here i reviewed your vitals and they overall look pretty good so that's a good sign now on your musculoskeletal back exam there is no overlying erythema and that just means redness or ecchymosis and that just means bruising of the skin now there is midline tenderness at l4 l5 disk space with right-sided lumbar paravertebral tenderness so do me a favor and i'm gon na just have you you know bend forward and straighten up a bit\n[patient] okay that's painful\n[doctor] sorry so definitely some pain with lumbar flexion and supine straight leg test is positive so on your neurological examination there is decreased sensation to light touch at the right lateral thigh at l4 dermatome okay and i'm just gon na take a look at your knees here real quick and then your your ankles so patellar and achilles reflexes are symmetrical so good now i reviewed the results of your mri and it shows disk herniation with nerve impingement so let me tell you about my assessment and plan here larry so for your problem of chronic lumbar back pain so based on your symptoms your exam and reviewing your mri results your symptoms are consistent with an l4 l5 herniated disk with radicul radiculopathy so this means that one of your disks that sits between your spinal vertebrae is bulging out and this bulge is pinching on some nerves and that's why you feel that tingling in your leg so yeah yeah so i am recommending a spinal injection with a strong inflammatory medication called a corticosteroid and what i do is i will inject the corticosteroid into that lumbar spine under fluoroscopy which you can think of you know an x-ray to help localize to the exact area of your pain now this should this should help the inflammation that is causing the pain so what do you think about that\n[patient] is there something i'm gon na have to do all the time\n[doctor] well you know patients are different so what we do is we will monitor you and we see how you respond to the injection and the patient's intervals can be different as well but we usually do not do more than four times a year\n[patient] okay okay\n[doctor] alright and it's not a long procedure it's it's relatively quick and common and you should be out of the office within an hour\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] alright sounds good\n[doctor] alright well let's go ahead and get you started on the first one today if that works for you if not we'll get you scheduled to start your first injection\n[patient] alright thank you\n[doctor] alright thank you\n[patient] bye\n</conversation>\nThe generated note will be provided in these tags:\n<response>\n**HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:**  \nLarry presents with a chronic back pain that has persisted for several years, initially starting after moving furniture. The pain is described as sharp and stabbing, radiating down to the right leg and toes, particularly the big toe. He reports difficulty getting comfortable, especially when sitting, and experiences numbness and tingling in the right leg and foot. He denies any loss of sensation in the genital or rectal area, weakness, or bladder/bowel control issues. Past interventions include physical therapy, temporary pain medications, and consideration of surgery, which he wishes to avoid. The pain has limited his activity, including golf, and has contributed to weight gain.\n\n**PHYSICAL EXAM:**  \nVitals are stable. Musculoskeletal exam shows no erythema or bruising but reveals midline tenderness at L4-L5 and right-sided lumbar paravertebral tenderness. Lumbar flexion is painful. Straight leg test is positive on the right. Neurological exam indicates decreased light touch sensation in the right lateral thigh at the L4 dermatome; patellar and Achilles reflexes are symmetrical. No signs of weakness or loss of sensation in the genital or rectal area.\n\n**RESULTS:**  \nMRI demonstrates a disk herniation at L4-L5 with nerve impingement, consistent with radiculopathy.\n\n**ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:**  \nLarry has chronic lumbar back pain due to an L4-L5 herniated disk causing nerve impingement and radiculopathy. The plan includes a lumbar epidural corticosteroid injection under fluoroscopy to reduce inflammation and alleviate symptoms. The patient is informed about the procedure, its frequency (not exceeding four times per year), and the expected quick recovery. The first injection will be scheduled today if agreeable. Follow-up will assess response to treatment.\n</response>\nThe reference note will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nLarry Garcia is a pleasant 41-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of back pain.\n\nThe onset of his pain began 2 years ago, after moving furniture. He denies any specific injury. The patient describes his pain as sharp and stabbing. He locates his pain to his lower back, which radiates distally into his right leg and occasionally into his great toe. Sitting will increase his pain and he notes he is unable to get comfortable. The patient also reports numbness and tingling, especially in his right leg that radiates distally to his foot. He adds that he tries to be as active as he can, however it has been difficult with his back pain. The patient adds that he has gained weight over the past year. He denies any loss of sensation in his genital or rectal area, weakness, or loss of bladder or bowel control.\n\nIn the past, he has attended physical therapy. The patient has also been prescribed pain medications, however they only provided temporary relief. He would like to avoid any surgical procedure at this time.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nHe quit smoking 20 years ago.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY\n\nThe patient denies any family history of spine conditions.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nConstitutional: Reports weight gain.\nMusculoskeletal: Reports lower back pain.\nNeurological: Positive for numbness and tingling in the right leg and foot. Denies loss of bowl or bladder control, or loss of sensation in the genital or rectal area.\n\nVITALS\n\nVitals are within normal limits.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nNEURO: Decreased sensation to light touch at the right lateral thigh at the L4 dermatome. Patellar and Achilles reflexes are symmetrical.\nMSK: Examination of the lumbar spine: No overlying erythema or ecchymosis. Midline tenderness at L4-5 disc space with right-sided lumbar paravertebral tenderness. Pain with lumbar flexion. Supine straight leg test is positive.\n\nRESULTS\n\nThe MRI of the lumbar spine was reviewed today. This revealed a disc herniation with nerve impingement.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nL4-5 herniated disc with radiculopathy.\n\nPLAN\n\nAfter reviewing the patient's examination and MRI findings today, I have discussed with the patient that his symptoms are consistent with an L4-5 herniated disc with radiculopathy. I have recommended that we treat the patient conservatively with a corticosteroid injection under fluoroscopy. With the patient's consent, we will proceed with a cortisone injection into the lumbar spine today.\n</gold_response>\nCarefully review the <response> based on the <conversation> and compare it to the <gold_response> when needed.\n\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Does the note provide correct clinical information based on the conversation?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the note include all important medical details from the conversation?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the note written clearly and organized in a standard clinical format for clinicians\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

He reports twisting his knee upon landing after a jump, with no audible or felt pop, but experienced stretching sensation and subsequent swelling. He was able to exit the water independently but reports significant soreness, especially with squatting or bending. He has not had prior knee injuries. He has been managing pain with over-the-counter Aleve and cold packs, which provided partial relief. He is concerned about skiing upcoming weekend activities.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM:\nVital signs are stable with blood pressure at 125/80 mm Hg. Examination reveals no lymphadenopathy, regular heart rhythm without murmurs, and clear lung auscultation. Right knee shows ecchymosis, edema, and effusion with tenderness to palpation. Range of motion is decreased and painful. Ligament testing (varus, valgus, Lachman) is negative. Distal pulses are palpable, and no lower extremity edema is noted.\n\nRESULTS:\nIn-office assessment indicates right knee ecchymosis, edema, and effusion consistent with soft tissue injury. No signs of ligament instability or neurovascular compromise. An x-ray of the right knee is ordered to rule out fractures.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\n1. Right knee strain (likely medial collateral ligament injury) with associated soft tissue swelling. \n   - Order right knee x-ray to exclude fracture.\n   - Prescribe meloxicam 15 mg once daily for inflammation and pain.\n   - Recommend rest and avoid activities that may worsen injury, including skiing until further evaluation.\n   - Refer to physical therapy for muscle strengthening.\n2.

i was out on my boat skiing and i i did a jump and kinda twisted when i landed and my knee has been hurting me ever since\n[doctor] okay so that was about five days ago then\n[patient] yeah yeah that was last weekend\n[doctor] last weekend okay now which knee is it\n[patient] it's my right knee\n[doctor] your right knee okay and i know that it sounds like you were on a motor boat as you were you know water skiing but did you hear anything pop or feel anything pop when it happened\n[patient] no it just felt like something stretched and then it swelled up some afterwards\n[doctor] okay and were you i assume that you were were you able to get out of the water by yourself or did you need some assistance\n[patient] i was able to get out but it was very sore to climb up and you know any kind of squatting or bending is really pretty sore\n[doctor] yeah okay and have you ever injured this knee before\n[patient] no that was the first time\n[doctor] that was the first time okay where do you have a boat what lake do you have it on lake\n[patient] lake martin\n[doctor] okay nice and so you're a frequent water skier\n[patient] yeah i try to go every weekend when we can\n[doctor] that's nice very very good are you looking forward to spring are you a baseball fan are you excited by opening day\n[patient] no i'm not a baseball fan but i love spring and chicken time of year launds of outdoor activities nice nice i'm i'm not really a baseball fan either but my husband makes me watch the the meds all the time and they lose all the time so he is always upset so so anyway\n[doctor] yeah right so how about your high blood pressure how are you doing with that are you taking your blood pressure medication like i asked\n[patient] i'm taking it everyday and i check my blood pressure at home and it's been about one twenty five over eighty most of the days\n[doctor] nice okay so i believe we have you on lisinopril about twenty milligrams a day any side effects from that that you're noticing\n[patient] not that i know of it's been a good medicine for me and i do n't have any trouble with it\n[doctor] okay great alright and since you had this knee pain any numbing or tingling in your foot at all\n[patient] no just the swelling and the pain\n[doctor] okay and what have you taken for the pain\n[patient] i i took some aleve twice a day some over the counter aleve twice a day\n[doctor] okay and\n[patient] putting a cold pack on it\n[doctor] okay and has that helped at all\n[patient] yeah that's helped a fair amount it's still pretty sore though\n[doctor] okay alright well let's see have you ever had any surgeries before let me just think any surgeries i do n't see any in your in your record here\n[patient] i had my tonsils out\n[doctor] okay you had your tonsils out okay alright well let me go ahead i wan na do a just a quick physical exam i'm gon na go ahead and be calling out some of my clinical exam findings and i'll let you know what that means when i'm done okay so looking at your vital signs here in the office it does look like you're doing a really good job managing your blood pressure your blood pressure is up is about one twenty over seventy seven today here in the office and that's with you probably in a little bit of pain so that's good and on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any lymphadenopathy on your heart exam your heart is a nice regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur on your lung exam your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally on your musculoskeletal exam on your right knee i do appreciate some ecchymosis some edema there is an effusion present does it hurt when i press\n[patient] yeah that's sore\n[doctor] okay there is pain to palpation of the right medial knee there is i'm just gon na bend your knee in all sorts of directions here does that hurt\n[patient] yeah do n't do that anymore\n[doctor] alright the patient has decreased range of motion there is a negative varus and valgus test there is a negative lachman sign there is a palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulse there is otherwise no lower extremity edema so what does that what does that mean kenneth so that so that means that you essentially i agree with you you had quite quite an injury to your knee and you do have a little bit of fluid in your knee there and just some inflammation which i think we need to talk about okay so i wan na go ahead and just talk a little bit about you know my assessment and my plan for you so for your first problem of your right knee pain i do believe you have what we call a a medial collateral ligament strain you know i wan na go ahead and just order an x-ray of your right knee just to make sure that we're not missing any broken bones which i do n't think we are but what's good about this particular injury is that people typically heal quite well from this and they typically do n't need surgery we can just go ahead and refer you to physical therapy to to strengthen those muscles around your knee so that you do n't have another injury and i wan na go ahead and just prescribe meloxicam fifteen milligrams once a day and that will help take down the swelling and help with some of the pain and you only have to take it once a day and it wo n't really cause any upset stomach or anything like that do you have any questions about that\n[patient] yeah if i start that medicine today am i going to be able to ski tomorrow because we got a a big weekend plan\n[doctor] i would say i would like you to rest your knee i i think that my concern is that if you go skiing again and you fall that you might injure your knee even more so i think you'll recover from this injury right now but i do n't want you to injure it anymore so i would rest it for a little while at least until we have the results of the x-ray and that type of thing okay for your second problem of your hypertension i wan na just go ahead and continue on lisinopril twenty milligrams a day i wan na just go ahead and order an a lipid panel just to make sure everything is okay from that standpoint and then i'm just looking through your health record and it looks like you're due for a tetanus shot so we'll go ahead and just give you a a tetanus shot for a from a health maintenance perspective any other questions\n[patient] i think so sounds like a good plan to me\n[doctor] okay sounds good alright so i'll see you later we'll get those ordered and i'll be in touch okay take care bye\n[patient] thank you\n</conversation>\nThe generated note will be provided

these tags:\n<conversation>\nDoctor-patient dialogue:\n\n[doctor] hey kyle it's nice to see you today can you tell me a little bit about what brought you in\n[patient] yeah i went to see my pcp for a cough which they diagnosed as bronchitis but then they did that chest x-ray to make sure i did n't have pneumonia and they found this lung nodule i went for a cat scan that confirmed it and they referred me here to you i'm really nervous document\n[doctor] okay well first of all i'm i'm sorry that you're nervous and what we're gon na do is we're gon na partner together okay and i'm gon na be right by your side the whole time to hopefully make you a little less nervous and and recognize the fact that we're you're gon na have a big support team around you okay\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] so let's talk a little bit about how long you've had that cough before you went to see your doctor\n[patient] i you know off and on i've had it for about three months i first noticed it when i was loading some pay i have horses and i i bought you know four hundred bills a day and when i spent a day loading it and then it's i just started coughing a lot more i think around that time and after that i i i just got a cold so that's what sent me to my pcp now i i i do exercise i i do a lot of biking and i typically do n't get sick and my cough has gone away\n[doctor] okay that's good to hear you mentioned exercise and biking i love to bike myself i've got a track seventy one hundred hybrid have you been on the the new trails they opened it was the old the old rail the old rail road right away they've opened that up it's like sixty miles of trails\n[patient] i love that that road i just i i do n't like riding on the road so i prefer to do those rails the trails type\n[doctor] yeah\n[patient] and it's just so phenomenal i do that a lot\n[doctor] yeah i love riding over there way we will we will get you all fixed up we will have to go for a bike ride\n[patient] absolutely i'd love it\n[doctor] that'd be great so i see here on your medical history that you also have a history of rheumatoid arthritis is that under control at this time and and and what do you do to to take care of your ra\n[patient] yeah it's it's it's fair you know arthritis never really goes away but i take methotrexate\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] i think it's seven and a half milligrams every week and as long as i'm keeping active my joints feel okay and if i do have any problems it's it's mostly with my hands but i have n't had any recent flares so i'm okay right now\n[doctor] okay that's good i also see here that you marked down that you were a previous smoker and and when when did you when did you stop smoking\n[patient] i stopped smoking probably about seven years ago\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] and i was young and should have stopped the way before that my kids were on me all the time but you know i i got a new start and finally was able to stop and i felt better after stopping\n[doctor] okay that's good and i'm glad to hear that you were able to to to stop and and stay tobacco free that that's great to hear do you have any pain or any shortness of breath or anything like that\n[patient] no not at all\n[doctor] okay and i would like to talk about your familial history here for just a second do you have any family history of lung cancer or any other type of malignancies\n[patient] no lung cancer my mom did have breast cancer but she is doing well now\n[doctor] okay alright and then things like lung infections or pneumonia do you have any previous history of that\n[patient] no no not not anything that i'm aware of\n[doctor] okay if it's okay with you i'm gon na do a quick physical exam your vital signs look good today blood pressure of one twenty four over seventy six heart rate of seventy respiration rate of sixteen o2 sat on room air of ninety eight percent and you are afebrile so you do n't have a fever today i'm gon na take a quick listen to your lungs here your lungs are clear and equal bilateral when i listen to them or when i auscultate your lungs now listening to your heart regular rate and rhythm no clicks rubs or murmurs and i do n't appreciate any extra beats doing a quick extremity exam your skin is pink warm and dry i do n't appreciate any edema to your lower extremities it looks like you do have a little bit of swelling to to your knuckles there on your third digit on each hand which can be normal for somebody who has ra however pulses are intact in all extremities and capillary refill is brisk so a quick review of your results now you had a chest ct before you came in to see me and the results of that chest ct do show a solitary two centimeter nodule in the lateral aspect of the right upper lobe now it appears the nodule is smooth in appearance and no evidence of any type of emphysematous disease is present which is good now for my assessment and plan for you so you do have an incidentally found right upper lobe lung nodule i'm going to order some pft which is pulmonary function test i just wan na get a check and and a baseline for your lung function i'm also going to schedule a pet ct this is gon na help to determine if that nodule is metabolically active meaning if it lights up it it can suggest that it's cancer or inflammatory i'm going to go ahead and suggest that we do remove this during or via video assisted thoracoscopy which means it's just gon na be three small incisions made on the side of your right chest i'm gon na go in with a camera and a scope and we'll remove that along with a very small portion of your lung you're gon na be under general anesthesia and it'll take about an hour and a half or so post procedure you're gon na be admitted and you will have a chest tube in until the following day and i'm gon na go ahead and take that out then at bedside most likely you're gon na be in the hospital for one night and go home the next day it could be a benign nodule but because your smoking history i really do think it's gon na be best that you have that removed now for your secondary concern of your rheumatoid arthritis i want you to continue to follow up with your rheumatologist and continue your medication therapy as has been previously outlined for you now do you have any questions comments or concerns before before we get the paperwork signed to start the the treatment process\n[patient] no i do n't think so i think i'll be okay i'm scared\n[doctor] i i know you're scared but we'll be right here with you the whole way\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] alright we'll get some paperwork and i'll see you again in a few minutes\n[patient] okay thank you\n</conversation>\nThe generated note will be provided in these

No clicks, rubs, or murmurs. Pulses are intact in all extremities.\n\nMusculoskeletal\n- Examination: No lower extremity edema. Mild swelling to the 3rd digit knuckles on the bilateral hands, consistent with RA.\n\nIntegumentary\n- Examination: Skin is pink, warm, and dry. Capillary refill is brisk.\n\nRESULTS\n\nCT scan of chest, obtained at an outside facility, is reviewed today and demonstrates a solitary 2 cm nodule in the lateral aspect of the right upper lobe. It appears the nodule is smooth in appearance. No evidence of any type of emphysematous disease is present.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN\n\n1. Right upper lobe lung nodule.\n- Medical Reasoning: The patient has incidentally found right upper lobe lung nodule visible on his chest CT. It could be a benign nodule, but because of his smoking history, I think it is best that he has it surgically removed.\n- Patient Education and Counseling: I had a thorough discussion with the patient concerning surgical treatment. Surgery will require general anesthesia and will take approximately 1.5 hours. I explained to the patient that his procedure will consist of 3 small incisions being made on the side of his right chest. I will then insert a camera and scope to assist in removing the nodule along with a very small portion of his lung. He was advised that he will be admitted for most likely an overnight stay. He will have a chest tube in until the following day when I remove it at his bedside. All questions were answered.\n- Medical Treatment: Pulmonary function test ordered today to obtain patient's baseline. PET CT will also be scheduled to determine if the nodule is metabolically active, which can suggest if it is cancerous or inflammatory. Nodule will be removed via video assisted thoracoscopy.\n\n2. Rheumatoid arthritis.\n- Medical Reasoning: Stable.\n- Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged the patient to continue to follow up with his rheumatologist.\n- Medical Treatment: Continue medication therapy and routine follow up with rheumatologist as previously outlined.\n\nPatient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.\n\n</gold_response>\nCarefully review the <response> based on the <conversation> and compare it to the <gold_response> when needed.\n\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Does the note provide correct clinical information based on the conversation?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the note include all important medical details from the conversation?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the note written clearly and organized in a standard clinical format for clinicians\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

high blood pressure so tyler tell me what's going on with your swallowing problem\n[patient] well it's just been something that i have noticed over the last you know four to five weeks it seems like something is always stuck in my throat and you know just i kinda go about my day and it kinda bothers me you know a little bit sometimes a little painful and when i try to eat it just seems like i have to i do n't know when it's something solid i kinda have to wash it down on occasion i i've never really fully choked but i have to admit that i've thought about potentially choking\n[doctor] okay and is it seem to be stuck in your throat or does it seem to go in your lungs area or are you coughing with this at all or just mostly when you're swallowing\n[patient] no coughing just kinda when i swallow it's all okay with liquids but when i kinda swallow you know like a bite of a sandwich sometimes it just feels like like i just need a little help pushing it down\n[doctor] okay and is it more kind of a like heart like steaks or heart like larger solid like things that are that you have to chew more or is it even soft stuff like you know to eat yogurt and stuff like that\n[patient] i'm not a hundred percent sure but i think it's probably more with solids\n[doctor] okay how about have you noticed anything different with when you're swallowing cold or or or hot liquids is there is there a temperature change any modification to that\n[patient] it's really just about solids\n[doctor] okay alright so have you noticed any blood in any place or blood in your stools or are you vomiting anything up at all\n[patient] no\n[doctor] okay that so no vomiting blood no coughing up blood or anything like that any weight loss or changes in your weight at all\n[patient] not that i want\n[doctor] okay yeah i mean i think we all like to lose a little bit of weight but yeah it's a it says it's a struggle so no no chest pain or shortness of breath with this\n[patient] no\n[doctor] okay so i i'm gon na you know we'll talk about that in a second i'll look at your throat as well and see what we need to do but it sounds like we may have to send you to a specialist to take a look at that and see if there is something causing this how about how are you doing with your diabetes by the way since i have n't seen you in a while i know we have you on metformin five hundred milligrams twice a day we checked your hemoglobin a1c last time was seven . four we talked about improving your diet and exercise how are things going\n[patient] i think they're going great i mean i'm taking my meds i'm sticking to them and i feel pretty good otherwise\n[doctor] okay are you checking your blood sugars in the morning or are you checking those at all\n[patient] yeah i do i mean once in a while i i'm in a hurry and i skip it but i have to say i probably do so about eighty percent of the time\n[doctor] and how are the numbers looking\n[patient] they're looking you know okay they are all within you know the range that we are targeting\n[doctor] okay alright and any any no nausea vomiting or diarrhea or any other side effects from the metformin or anything like that\n[patient] no\n[doctor] okay good so i think we should probably repeat your hemoglobin a1c it sounds like you've you know you've improved your diet and it sounds like you've you're following the regimen so maybe the numbers will be better this time and we do n't have to change your medication so that will be awesome how are you doing with your blood pressure i know we have you on norvasc we asked that you check it like you know once a week or more than that if you have time blood pressure looks good today in the office it's about one fifty i'm sorry one twenty over fifty right now so no nothing here in the office how are things at home\n[patient] i get there now every once in a while you know the lower numbers a little bit you know higher but it's not you know usually it's either close or or on on range\n[doctor] okay alright good so let me examine you now so tyler i'm examining you now i'm gon na just verbalize some of my findings your neck is fine i do n't see any swelling in your neck your thyroid feels normal i do n't feel any masses in your neck there's no lymph nodes i'm looking at your throat and that looks okay there is no masses or any swelling that i can see there is no redness yeah there is no carotid bruit your lung exam is clear your heart exam is normal no murmurs on your belly exam you have some epigastric tenderness right here in the right here where i'm pressing but i do n't feel any masses or any significant swelling back there no normal back exam your extremity exam looks normal your neurological exam's fine so for this difficulty swallowing i'm concerned that you may have a narrowing in your throat that's causing this and sometimes it can be from a stricture where some narrowing of the esophagus and sometimes i need to go in and dilate that so i'm gon na go ahead and send you give you a referral for gastroenterology and have them do a scope and take a look down there i'm gon na recommend we put you on some prilosec sometimes also reflux medicine can if you have reflux sometimes that can also exacerbate this sometimes so i'm gon na put you on some prilosec twenty milligrams once a day again i'm gon na recommend that you chew your foods frequently and make sure you have a you know especially if you're eating something hard like steak or meat chew them really well so they do n't get tend to get stuck some people have sometimes things get stuck and they do n't go down and if that happens as an emergency you do have to go to the emergency department but seems like you know things are going down they just seem to sometimes slow down or get stuck temporarily so why do n't i get you a referral for gi we will start you on the prilosec and then we will have you you know if you you know if you have any other symptoms or worsenings give my office a call we will get you in or get you referred to the er if needed any questions about that\n[patient] no that sounds great\n[doctor] okay and for the diabetes i'm gon na order another hemoglobin a1c i'm gon na order some more blood work today we'll check a kidney function and i notice that you have not had an eye referral so i'm gon na also give you an eye referral to ophthalmology to check your eyes for your diabetic for your for any retinopathy continue the metformin i'll have you come back in about a month and that way we'll have the results back for the blood test if we need to make any adjustments we can but i i wan na see you back in about a month and i think that's it for that any questions about that\n[patient] no\n[doctor] okay and the high blood pressure i think you're doing great continue with the norvasc if you have any issues certainly call me but otherwise there is really nothing else to add for that did we forget anything or do you need refills for anything\n[patient] you know i think i'm low on the norvasc so if you could send something to my pharmacy that would be great\n[doctor] okay sure i'll get you a refill for norvasc we'll get that sent over to the pharmacy okay\n[patient] thank you\n[doctor] alright thanks good seeing you thanks for coming in to them\n</conversation>\nThe generated note will be provided in these

Difficulty swallowing.\n- Medical Reasoning: The patient describes difficulty swallowing when he eats solid foods.\n- Patient Education and Counseling: We discussed that I am concerned he has a narrowing in his throat that is causing this. I advised the patient the gastroenterology will do a scope. I recommended Prilosec as he might be experiencing reflux. We discussed that he should eat his food slowly and chew his food frequently. I advised the patient to call our office if his symptoms worsen.\n- Medical Treatment: I referred the patient to gastroenterology. I prescribed Prilosec 20 mg once a day.\n\n2. Diabetes.\n- Medical Reasoning: This seems well-controlled.\n- Patient Education and Counseling: The patient will continue with his metformin as he seems to be doing well. I advised the patient to follow up in 1 month for results and any adjustments that may be needed.\n- Medical Treatment: Continue metformin 500 mg twice a day. I ordered another hemoglobin A1c, as well as a kidney function test. I referred the patient to ophthalmology for retinopathy.\n\n3. High blood pressure.\n- Medical Reasoning: This seems well-controlled.\n- Patient Education and Counseling: I advised the patient to continue his current medication, Norvasc.\n- Medical Treatment: I refilled the Norvasc.\n\nPatient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nThe patient will follow-up in 1 month for his diabetic lab results and any modifications needed.\n\n</gold_response>\nCarefully review the <response> based on the <conversation> and compare it to the <gold_response> when needed.\n\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Does the note provide correct clinical information based on the conversation?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the note include all important medical details from the conversation?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the note written clearly and organized in a standard clinical format for clinicians\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

son sean i think you met in the past he he started playing basketball and there we do multiple seasons and so we're kinda getting ready for the next season that starts in in april and we were at the courts plan and i went up for a shot and he's far more aggressive than with me than he is with you know his peers i guess he could say and so he he found me while i was going for a lap and then when i came down i kind of landed awkwardly and i kind of like rolled and twisted my my ankle so now it's it's hurting a bit like kind of on the outside you can you can even see it's it's bruised up and a bit swollen\n[doctor] yeah\n[patient] and yeah i've been having trouble walking and it just does n't feel solid really stable which is a problem i i recently got back into working out and i had been in a really good rhythm going to the gym\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] and i do n't want to disrupt that moments on because it took a lot for me to get back to a good place so\n[doctor] absolutely okay totally understand that glad to hear that you're back out on the court playing with your son how is he doing by the way\n[patient] he is doing great he is doing great i mean you know he is a big step kurry fan so he likes to keep up shots from from way out past the three point line and he is only ten and tiny so it's it's not a good idea for him to do that but he is doing really well and i'm just happy he's tried every sport and basketball's really what took so i'm just really happy that he has a sport and loves and couple of his buddies playing to lead with him so it's just makes me happy that he's found something he really enjoys\n[doctor] good good to hear alright well let's take a look at that ankle it looks like it's pretty swollen so let me just do a quick exam on that right now alright so looks like the outside of your ankle if i push on that does that hurt pretty bad\n[patient] yeah yes\n[doctor] okay so exquisite tenderness tenderness laterally and then if i push here does that hurt too\n[patient] yeah a little bit\n[doctor] okay so some tenderness over the medial deltoid region so swelling on the lateral side of the ankle no epidermolysis skin is intact looks like you have brisk capillary refill no horrible malalignment so alright can you can you stand on it did you say that you're having trouble walking at all\n[patient] yeah i mean i can stand on it and i ca n't walk on it it just it hurts and it feels like i'm going to possibly injure it more just because it does n't feel particularly solid\n[doctor] sure so it does n't quite feel stable\n[patient] yeah\n[doctor] okay okay i gotcha so i know you had an x-ray as you came in today and so i'm just looking at this x-ray here i'll show you on the screen right here i can turn my monitor towards you this is an ap lateral oblique and this is your right ankle so what we're looking at is a displaced lateral malleolus at the weber c level there's no evidence of medial or posterior malleolar fractures but this is a fracture on the lateral side of your ankle now based on the position it's a bit unstable that's why you're feeling some of that that instability when you're walking so for your diagnosis what i'm gon na put down is a lateral malleolar fracture and what i would recommend for that since it is in the location that it is is you're probably unfortunately gon na need surgery we're gon na wan na get that healed what that includes is putting some plate and some screws in and you're gon na be out for a little bit so i know you've been trying to work out and and you wan na get back on the court but but you may have to have to sit out for a little bit we'll get you some crutches\n[patient] how long it's a little bit because i'm also i i forgot to say i'm also i did volunteer to coach\n[doctor] great\n[patient] starting in april so\n[doctor] alright well\n[patient] how long\n[doctor] yeah you you're probably gon na be out for about three months but continue the coaching go ahead and and let's get you back out there we'll get you some crutches and and hopefully you can kinda you know get back on the court start coaching and then within that three months we'll we'll get you back out doing some exercise again\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] alright in the meantime i'm gon na prescribe some medication for now let's try meloxicam and try to get some of the swelling down i want you to ice it and also keep that that ankle elevated do you have a job where you can elevate your ankle regularly\n[patient] yeah i i work from home so that that should n't be a problem it's just everything else i do n't know who is gon na walk my dogs and and do all this stuff that's rest of my family refuses to walk my dog so we'll figure it out\n[doctor] yeah i i'm a dog walker as well so alright sorry for the bad news but let's get you healed up so that we can get you back out doing everything you need to do\n[patient] alright thank you doctor\n[doctor] alright

today\n[patient] good to see you mister edwards i'm doctor\n[doctor] tell me what's been going on yeah so i've got this stabbing shooting pain i've had for a while you know and it it especially right here in my right face right in that cheek bone area it's sometimes it gets super hot i've had it for i think a couple of months now and i went to my family doctor and they said i should come see you\n[patient] okay great i would like to ask you a little bit more about that\n[doctor] had in your face do you remember how long that you had it probably for about two or three months just just came on slowly i started noticing it but now it's i have episodes where just shooting stabbing kind of a pain in my right cheek bone right face area\n[patient] mm-hmm do you have any sensory loss meaning like numbness or tingling in that part of your face\n[doctor] not that i've noticed no okay do you have any symptoms like this anywhere else on your face including the other side of your face\n[patient] no it's just on the right side mostly not on the left side just on the right side of my face\n[doctor] have you noticed any weakness on that side of the face like when you smile or while you're doing other things any weakness there not really i mean i've i've i've tried to you know when i smile my smile seems equal on both sides my eyes i do n't have any weakness there my vision seems to be unchanged but just this stabbing severe pain it's just like excruciating pain that i get sometimes does it happen on its own or there are certain things that trigger it\n[patient] sometimes if i'm if certain temperatures seem to trigger it sometimes or if it's super where it's cold i get a trigger sometimes\n[doctor] sometimes certain kind of sensory outside of the wind sometimes that seems to trigger it but that's about it\n[patient] okay and anything that you've done to to that helps for a little bit when you\n[doctor] pain excess\n[patient] you know i've tried ibuprofen and motrin that had really has n't helped it just comes on suddenly and then it's kinda stabbing excruciating pain i've tried rubbing some you know some tiger balm on it that did n't work\n[doctor] but that's you know so i i went to my family doctor and he said you know i really need to see a neurosurgeon\n[patient] got it how long do these episodes last these pain\n[doctor] you know it can last for anywhere from a few minutes to sometimes about an hour but generally generally a few minutes\n[patient] any history of something like multiple sclerosis or any brain tumors that you know\n[doctor] no nothing like that alright any other kinda headache symptoms that have anything like you had migraines or anything related to the headaches i mean i get occasional headaches but not really i do n't have a history of migraines but i occasionally get headaches like everybody else i take some tylenol that usually goes away but this is different\n[patient] how severe is the pain on a scale of one to ten\n[doctor] when it comes on it's like a ten it's like somebody is stabbing you with an ice pick and but usually you know after a few minutes usually it goes away but sometimes it can last up to an hour great so mister i would like to do a physical exam if that's okay with you\n[patient] sure\n[doctor] i would like you to follow my finger here and i see that you're following my finger in in both directions can you show me your teeth\n[patient] that looks nice and symmetric i'm gon na rub my fingers next to your ear can you hear that\n[doctor] yep\n[patient] you can hear it on the other side as well\n[doctor] yep\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] i'm gon na take this cotton tape and run it along the side of your face can you feel that okay\n[patient] yeah it's a little bit numb on my right side not so much on my left side\n[doctor] okay alright i'm gon na use this little needle here and i'm gon na poke here and i wan na see if you feel like it's being sharp or dull on that part of your face does that feel different or normal\n[patient] it feels a little bit dull on my left on my right side my left side it feels sharp\n[doctor] alright good well i had a chance to look at your mri\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] and i looked at your mri and it appears to have small blood vessel that is abutting and perhaps even pinching the trigeminal nerve the trigeminal nerve is nerve that comes from the brainstem that goes out to the face and provides the sensory inflammation from the face and you may have a condition called trigeminal neuralgia\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] where the nerve compression causes this kind of shooting electrical pain in the face how do we treat it\n[patient] well the first line would be to try some medications usually we start with medications that are called gabapentin\n[doctor] or tegretol these are medications that really help reduce the excitability of the nerve\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] most people can get the pain control with that but there are some people where the medications are n't gon na be enough and in that situation we would consider surgery i would n't i would n't recommend that now we usually try the medications first\n[patient] for considering a surgery to decompress the nerve the root cause of the problem is the compression of the blood vessel against the nerve\n[doctor] okay so we should be tried which one would you recommend the tegretol or yeah i think we could start with the tegretol to start with i just want to make sure that you understand some of the potential side effects that you can have with this\n[patient] sure\n[doctor] it's always a little bit of trial and error to figure out what the right dosing that would work for you but some common side effects can include you know memory loss tingling imbalance some people can actually have like dermatologic\n[patient] skin reaction to this medication and particularly people who have eustachian descent so that we may do some genetic testing just to make sure that it will be safe for you\n[doctor] okay sounds good let's do it\n[patient] okay so i will prescribe that for you and then we will see how that goes and if your pain continues we can talk about different surgical options to treat the pain\n[doctor] yeah i think i would like to try the tegretol first and if that does n't work then i can come back and so once should i come back and just to kinda check back with you and see if you know if it's had enough time for a fact or not\n[patient] i think one month would be a great time to follow up\n[doctor] okay sounds good so if you want to send that prescription over to my pharmacy that would be fine and then why do n't i come back in about a month and we'll go from there\n[patient] great i'll see you

The patient was counseled on potential side effects, including memory issues, tingling, imbalance, and skin reactions, with consideration for genetic testing to assess suitability. A one-month follow-up is scheduled to evaluate response to medication. If pain persists or worsens, surgical options such as nerve decompression may be considered. The prescription for Tegretol will be sent to the pharmacy, and the patient will return in approximately one month for reassessment.\n</response>\nThe reference note will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nCHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nRight-sided facial pain.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nEyes: Denies vision changes or weakness in right eye.\nHENT: Reports right sided facial pain. Denies left sided facial pain. Neurological: Reports headaches. Denies sensory loss, numbness, or tingling in the right cheek. Denies right sided facial weakness.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nNeurological\n- Orientation: Light touch testing of the right side of the face reveals numbness when compared to the contralateral side. Pinprick testing is sharp on the left side of the face; dull on the right side of the face.\n\nEars, Nose, Mouth, and Throat\nBilateral finger rub test is negative.\n- Examination of Mouth: Teeth are symmetric.\n\nRESULTS\n\nMRI of the head is reviewed today. This demonstrates a small blood vessel that is abutting, and perhaps even pinching, the right trigeminal nerve.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN\n\n1. Trigeminal neuralgia.\n- Medical Reasoning: The patient has been experiencing facial pain for 2 to 3 months. A recent MRI revealed a small blood vessel abutting, or perhaps even pinching, the right trigeminal nerve. The root cause of his facial pain is the compression of the blood vessel against this nerve.\n- Patient Education and Counseling: The patient and I discussed treatment options including medicating with gabapentin or Tegretol. I explained the common side effects associated with these medications can include memory loss, tingling, and imbalance. We discussed the need for genetic testing due to the possible side effect of dermatologic reactions in people of East Asian descent. We also briefly discussed surgical treatment to decompress the nerve, but this is not recommended at this time.\n- Medical Treatment: A prescription for Tegretol will be sent to the patient\u2019s pharmacy.\n\nPatient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nThe patient will follow up with me in 1 month. If at that time his facial pain persists, we may further discuss surgical options.\n</gold_response>\nCarefully review the <response> based on the <conversation> and compare it to the <gold_response> when needed.\n\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Does the note provide correct clinical information based on the conversation?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the note include all important medical details from the conversation?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the note written clearly and organized in a standard clinical format for clinicians\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

leg edema in the ankle okay well let's just talk a little bit about you know my assessment and you know my plan for you so you know i know that you had the x-ray done of your of your right knee that did n't show any bony abnormality but i i'm concerned that you have ruptured your your acl or your anterior cruciate ligament that's like a major ligament that helps connect and helps your knee move back and forth so i wan na go ahead and order a knee mri just so that we can get a a a good look and just you know confirm that physical exam okay now some people can have a normal physical exam and

Her injury was sustained while skiing in Vermont last weekend after she caught her ski when coming off of the lift and fell. She reports a pop in her knee at the time of injury and has been experiencing pain since that time. Due to her fall she was unable to weight bear and had to be taken down by the ski patrol. She locates her pain to the lateral aspect of her knee and also describes the feeling of instability as well as buckling. At this time she is experiencing difficulty with knee flexion; however, she states this was not a problem immediately after the injury. Full knee extension is also quite painful for her. The patient denies any numbness or tingling in her toes. She is currently utilizing crutches for ambulation which were provided to her by the ski patrol. In terms of pain control, she is taking ibuprofen which is providing some relief.\n\nMEDICAL HISTORY\n\nPatient reports she is otherwise healthy and denies a history of high blood pressure or diabetes.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nPatient reports she is very active with skiing and taking care of her 4-year-old twins. She mentions that she would like to get back into running at some point. She states that her husband is home with her, but he also works a job where he has gone quite a bit.\n\nMEDICATIONS\n\nPatient reports she is taking ibuprofen.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nMusculoskeletal: Reports right knee pain and limited range of motion.\nNeurological: Denies numbness or tingling in toes.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nGAIT: The patient is ambulating with crutches.\nCV: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmur.\nRESPIRATORY: Lungs are clear to auscultation.\nMSK: Examination of the right knee: Edema and effusion noted. Pain with palpation of the lateral knee. Decreased flexion and extension. Positive Lachman's. Palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulse. No ankle edema.\n\nRESULTS\n\n4 views of the right knee were taken today. These reveal no bony abnormalities.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nRight knee pain, possible ACL tear.\n\nPLAN\n\nAfter reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to her current symptoms. I have recommended that we obtain an MRI of the right knee to evaluate for a possible ACL tear. In the meantime, I have advised her to continue taking ibuprofen 600 to 800 mg every 8 hours as needed for pain. She will also be placed into a brace for increased knee support.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nThe patient will follow up with me once the MRI results are available for review and further discussion.\n</gold_response>\nCarefully review the <response> based on the <conversation> and compare it to the <gold_response> when needed.\n\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Does the note provide correct clinical information based on the conversation?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the note include all important medical details from the conversation?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the note written clearly and organized in a standard clinical format for clinicians\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

    "predicted_text": "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:\nBrandon presents with severe neck pain following multiple recent motor vehicle accidents, with the most recent occurring in February. He reports sharp, incapacitating pain rated 12/10, which worsens with movement, especially when bending the neck forward or backward. He also experiences associated symptoms including headaches, occasional dizziness, numbness in the left arm and right leg, spasms, and some bruising. He notes that the pain has prevented him from working and has persisted since the recent crash. He has a history of previous crashes, therapy, and neck surgery, and was recently prescribed fentanyl, which he has not used for several weeks.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM:\nOn examination, Brandon exhibits tenderness on palpation of the neck, both over bony and muscular structures. Range of motion is moderately limited, with significant pain on movement, especially when attempting to bend the neck forward or backward. No visible bruising, swelling, or lacerations are noted today, although he reports occasional bruising. No signs of skin trauma are observed. Neurological assessment reveals numbness in the left arm and right leg, with associated spasms. No evidence of bruising or swelling at present.\n\nRESULTS:\nRecent imaging (X-ray) shows no evidence of fracture. Given the severity of symptoms and mechanism of injury, a decision was made to proceed with advanced imaging\u2014an MRI\u2014to evaluate soft tissues, discs, and neural structures more thoroughly. The MRI is scheduled to provide detailed assessment of potential ligamentous injury, disc herniation, or nerve impingement.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\nBrandon is diagnosed with a neck sprain likely secondary to trauma from multiple motor vehicle accidents, with no evidence of fracture on initial X-ray. The severity of pain and neurological symptoms warrant conservative management with close monitoring. The plan includes:\n- Ordering an MRI to evaluate soft tissue and neural structures.\n- Advising rest and activity modification, including off work status until further evaluation.\n- Applying ice to areas of bruising and swelling as needed.\n- Initiating medication with Robaxin (methocarbamol) 1500 mg every 6-8 hours to relax muscles and reduce pain.\n- Providing instructions for gentle neck exercises to improve mobility.\n- Considering additional pain management options, including potential referral to pain specialist for local injections if necessary.\n- Follow-up after MRI results to determine further treatment, including possible physical therapy or other interventions.\n- Monitoring for symptom progression or neurological deficits.",

multiple things but thankfully it's not a broken neck is that okay\n[patient] yes\n[doctor] alright so what we are gon na do when we are gon na like try and treat this as conservatively as possible\n[patient] said it might be broken\n[doctor] what\n[patient] pamela said it might be broken\n[doctor] if pamela said it's broken then you know what this is what we're gon na do we're gon na order something called a ct that's gon na give us even nope you know what let's upgrade to an mri it's gon na give us the most thorough image of everything that's going on the heart and the soft tissues is that gon na is that so that way we can really get a good image of what's happening inside right\n[patient] okay because what the lawyer said i needed was an mri\n[doctor] not a problem we're we're gon na make your lawyer happy next step we are going to try working like from the outside in so i do need you to work on getting like you're you're saying you've seen some bruising and some swelling yourself so i want you to put ice on that whenever you're experiencing that in the moment when you wake up i want you to do your best to just like i'm gon na give you some exercises on the sheet and i want you to roll through these exercises every morning right to just get some like movement and like free frenosive movement back into your neck i also wan na put you on a couple medications now i know that you said you were on fentanyl before that's a bit extreme and i i want i i i wan na like monitor this a little more conservatively so what we're gon na start with is something called robaxin\n[patient] hurts a lot if i do n't get more fentanyl\n[doctor] you know we can refer you to pain medicine if it really is getting that complicated but for this current period we're gon na put you on some robaxin it's gon na be fifteen hundred milligrams and you're gon na take that six to eight hours every six to eight hours and that really should help kinda relax the muscles in the area take off some of that tension and really help with that pain if you're noticing that the robaxin still is n't helping maybe then we can start we can like start using like a heat pad or maybe some icyhot the biofreeze is a really good one to kinda help with that and then we will refer you to physical therapy i think with the mri we can start evaluating maybe some additional steps so rather than you having to like take that fentanyl because i do n't want you to be in danger right like people i do n't want you to get rubbed so what we could explore are local injections right and we can refer you to pain medication and see about like locally injecting the area and that should be able to help you out hopefully with this\n[patient] i ca n't go to work like this\n[doctor] okay so if it's if it's that bad let's wait for the mri result we're gon na give you off for work because you know you ca n't move and we'll see what the mri says about what whether or not we can get you like true local injections in the moment is that alright for now\n[patient] yeah\n[doctor] okay okay any other questions\n[patient] not right now\n[doctor] alright\n</conversation>\nThe generated note will be provided in these tags:\n<response>\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:\nBrandon presents with severe neck pain following multiple recent motor vehicle accidents, with the most recent occurring in February. He reports sharp, incapacitating pain rated 12/10, which worsens with movement, especially when bending the neck forward or backward. He also experiences associated symptoms including headaches, occasional dizziness, numbness in the left arm and right leg, spasms, and some bruising. He notes that the pain has prevented him from working and has persisted since the recent crash. He has a history of previous crashes, therapy, and neck surgery, and was recently prescribed fentanyl, which he has not used for several weeks.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM:\nOn examination, Brandon exhibits tenderness on palpation of the neck, both over bony and muscular structures. Range of motion is moderately limited, with significant pain on movement, especially when attempting to bend the neck forward or backward. No visible bruising, swelling, or lacerations are noted today, although he reports occasional bruising. No signs of skin trauma are observed. Neurological assessment reveals numbness in the left arm and right leg, with associated spasms. No evidence of bruising or swelling at present.\n\nRESULTS:\nRecent imaging (X-ray) shows no evidence of fracture. Given the severity of symptoms and mechanism of injury, a decision was made to proceed with advanced imaging\u2014an MRI\u2014to evaluate soft tissues, discs, and neural structures more thoroughly. The MRI is scheduled to provide detailed assessment of potential ligamentous injury, disc herniation, or nerve impingement.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\nBrandon is diagnosed with a neck sprain likely secondary to trauma from multiple motor vehicle accidents, with no evidence of fracture on initial X-ray. The severity of pain and neurological symptoms warrant conservative management with close monitoring. The plan includes:\n- Ordering an MRI to evaluate soft tissue and neural structures.\n- Advising rest and activity modification, including off work status until further evaluation.\n- Applying ice to areas of bruising and swelling as needed.\n- Initiating medication with Robaxin (methocarbamol) 1500 mg every 6-8 hours to relax muscles and reduce pain.\n- Providing instructions for gentle neck exercises to improve mobility.\n- Considering additional pain management options, including potential referral to pain specialist for local injections if necessary.\n- Follow-up after MRI results to determine further treatment, including possible physical therapy or other interventions.\n- Monitoring for symptom progression or neurological deficits.\n</response>\nThe reference note will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nCHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nNeck pain.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nBrandon Green is a pleasant 46-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of neck pain. His pain began when he was involved in a motor vehicle accident in 02/2022 when he was on his way home from a pain clinic. The patient notes that he has been in 4 motor vehicle accidents; however, he notes that he was fine after the first two accidents, but the third motor vehicle accident is when his neck and back pain began. He states that he was in therapy following the second accident and had surgery after his third accident. The patient was seen at a pain clinic secondary to neck and back pain. He was prescribed fentanyl; however, he has not received a prescription for several weeks. Today, he reports that his pain is a 12 out of 10. He describes his pain as sharp and incapacitating with stiffness and pain. The patient also reports headaches, occasional dizziness. He denies any recent visual disturbances. He also reports numbness in his left arm and right leg. The patient also reports spasms throughout his body. He states that he has been experiencing fatigue since the accident. He notes that he is unable to work with this much pain.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nConstitutional: Reports fatigue.\nEyes: Denies any recent visual disturbances.\nMusculoskeletal: Reports neck and back pain, and occasional swelling and bruising of the neck.\nNeurological: Reports headaches, dizziness, spasms, and numbness.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nSKIN: No lacerations.\nMSK: Examination of the cervical spine: Pain on palpation on the bony process and muscle. Moderate ROM. No bruising or edema noted.\n\nRESULTS\n\nX-rays of the neck reveal no fractures.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nNeck sprain.\n\nPLAN\n\nAfter reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. I have explained to him that his x-rays did not reveal any signs of a fracture. I recommended an MRI for further evaluation. I have also prescribed the patient Robaxin 1500 mg every 6 to 8 hours to treat his pain. I have also advised him to utilize ice, a heating pad, IcyHot, or Biofreeze on his neck as needed. I have also provided him with a home exercise program to work on his range of motion. I advised the patient that he will not be able to work until we have the MRI results.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nThe patient will follow up with me after his MRI for results.\n</gold_response>\nCarefully review the <response> based on the <conversation> and compare it to the <gold_response> when needed.\n\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Does the note provide correct clinical information based on the conversation?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the note include all important medical details from the conversation?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the note written clearly and organized in a standard clinical format for clinicians\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

He reports feeling lightheaded and experiencing difficulty catching his breath afterward, which resolved after about an hour. He denies chest pain at the time of symptoms but mentions that he may have had mild chest discomfort during the episode. He has a history of cold symptoms a year and a half ago with a brief cough that resolved. No fever, nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain reported. He has no recent sick contacts. He reports that his migraines and reflux are well-controlled with medication.\n\n**PHYSICAL EXAM:**  \nVital signs are within normal limits with excellent oxygenation. Physical exam reveals a supple neck without jugular venous distension. Cardiac exam shows a regular rhythm without murmurs. Lung auscultation reveals bilateral expiratory wheezes. Trace lower extremity edema is noted. No other abnormalities observed.\n\n**RESULTS:**  \n- Chest X-ray: Normal, no pulmonary edema or pneumonia.  \n- Pulmonary Function Tests: Normal.  \n- Laboratory Tests: All labs are within normal limits.\n\n**ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:**  \nAlan's presentation suggests a possible asthma exacerbation triggered by exercise and allergies. Prescribed albuterol inhaler (two puffs every four hours as needed for wheezing or shortness of breath). Referred to pulmonary specialist for further evaluation. Reassured that chest imaging and pulmonary function tests are normal. Continued management of reflux and migraines as previously prescribed. Advised to return or contact immediately if symptoms recur. Follow-up scheduled in two weeks.\n</response>\nThe reference note will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nCHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nShortness of breath.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nAlan Butler is a 61-year-old male presenting with complaints of shortness of breath.\n\nThe patient states that over the weekend, he took a very long bike ride for approximately 3 hours, and when he returned, he was very lightheaded and short of breath. He notes that it was difficult to catch his breath afterward. He endorses that he had mild chest pain at that time, however, it eventually went away after about an hour. He denies any fever at this time or any other symptoms at this time. No other members in his family have been sick.\n\nThe patient is currently taking Imitrex as needed for his migraines. His migraines are under control and he avoids exposure to bright lights.\n\nThe patient is currently taking Protonix for his reflux and he is doing well with this.\n\nThe patient had cataract surgery about 4.5 months ago. He notes that his vision is okay since then.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\n\u2022 Constitutional: No fevers.\n\u2022 Cardiovascular: Endorses chest pain and dyspnea on exertion.\n\u2022 Respiratory: Endorses a cough. Endorses shortness of breath.\n\u2022 Gastrointestinal: Endorses reflux.\n\u2022 Neurological: Endorses migraines. Endorses lightheadedness.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION\n\n\u2022 Neck: Supple.\u00a0 No jugular venous distension.\n\u2022 Respiratory: Slight expiratory wheezing bilaterally.\n\u2022 Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs.\n\u2022 Musculoskeletal: Trace edema in the bilateral lower extremities.\n\nRESULTS\n\nPulmonary function test are within normal limits.\n\nX-ray of the chest is unremarkable.\n\nCBC: Within normal limits.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN\n\nThe patient is a 61-year-old male who presents for shortness of breath.\n\nShortness of breath.\n\u2022 Medical Reasoning: I reviewed the patient's chest x-ray, pulmonary function test, and labs which were all normal. He does have slight expiratory wheezing bilaterally on exam. I suspect his episode of shortness of breath was due to an exacerbation of asthma.\n\u2022 Medical Treatment: I would like to prescribe an albuterol inhaler, 2 puffs every 4 hours as needed for wheezing or shortness of breath.\n\u2022 Specialist Referral: I have referred him to pulmonology for an asthma workup.\n\nAcid reflux.\n\u2022 Medical Reasoning: This seems stable.\n\u2022 Medical Treatment: I recommended the patient continue Protonix.\n\nMigraines.\n\u2022 Medical Reasoning: This problem is also stable. Continue on Imitrex as needed.\n\u2022 Medical Treatment: I recommended he continue Imitrex as needed for migraines.\n\nPatient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nThe patient will follow-up in 2 weeks or sooner if his conditions worsen.\n</gold_response>\nCarefully review the <response> based on the <conversation> and compare it to the <gold_response> when needed.\n\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Does the note provide correct clinical information based on the conversation?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the note include all important medical details from the conversation?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the note written clearly and organized in a standard clinical format for clinicians\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

She reports that over the past couple of months, her energy has really gone down. She used to be really active, trying to be as healthy as she can be with running and climbing, at least an hour or two a day. Over the past month, her activity has slowly decreased. She reports that, due to her fatigue, she has not been able to keep up with her exercise. She reports that she had noticed a little weight loss, but she believes that was due to her doing really well with her exercises.\n\nThe patient reports that her COPD is doing well. She reports that she has not been smoking since she quit. She reports that during the changes of the season, it gets a little harder for her to breathe, but she believes that is because of her allergies.\n\nFrom a congestive heart failure standpoint, she reports that she has been doing really well with her diet. She reports that she has been staying away from French fries and all the other salty foods that she likes to eat. She denies any swelling in her legs.\n\nShe reports that she has a good support system with her boyfriend and her brother.\n\nShe reports that she has not noticed any blood in her stool at this time. She denies that her stools are dark or black in color. She denies that she has had any abnormal bleeding between menses.

She presents for her annual exam.\n\nThe patient states she has been doing okay with her herniated disc in her back. She has not had any back pain or any limitations in movement. She had a steroid injection for her herniated disc several months ago, which has been doing well.\n\nHer right carpal tunnel release was performed a couple of years ago and she is back to work. She has full range of motion and it feels really good. No numbness or tingling in her hands.\n\nShe has had prior stenting for her heart and heart vessels in the past. Over the last month, she reports chest pain approximately 3-4 times a week with ambulation. Her chest pain does resolve with rest. The pain is described as burning and is located in the middle of her chest. She denies pain at rest.\n\nShe has had a little bit of nasal congestion from allergies.

He reports initial post-nasal drip that has since moved to his chest, with no associated sinus pain, fevers (only slight suspicion), or shortness of breath. He denies any recent sick contacts at home. He notes that he has been compliant with his diet overall, though recent travel may have affected his adherence. He reports no chest pain aside from congestion and is able to exercise as before illness.\n\n2. PHYSICAL EXAM:\nVital signs are within normal limits with oxygen saturation at 96%. Physical exam reveals cervical lymphadenopathy, bilateral ronchi, and wheezing in the lungs, indicating respiratory infection. No chest pain or other significant findings noted.\n\n3. RESULTS:\nLipid panel shows good cholesterol control; no changes needed. COVID-19 test returned positive, likely a mild infection given the patient's vaccination status and stable oxygenation. No other abnormal labs reported.\n\n4. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\n- COVID-19 infection: Mild, vaccinated individual. Advise quarantine for 10 days, avoid contact with household members, and monitor symptoms. Patient instructed to contact the clinic if symptoms worsen.\n- Hyperlipidemia: Continue Crestor 20 mg daily, maintain diet, and repeat lipid panel in six months.\n- Coronary artery disease: No current chest pain, exercising well.

She reports that her overall condition is \"pretty good\" with no new complaints. She has a history of poorly controlled diabetes with an HbA1c of 9.9, and her current medication regimen includes glimepiride 2 mg daily. She has not increased her glimepiride dose as previously advised. She reports trying to eat healthier, with limited pasta and bread (mostly wheat), and drinks seltzer water. She has a history of hypertension, managed with metoprolol, lisinopril with hydrochlorothiazide, and amlodipine, with recent blood pressure readings around 116-140 mm Hg systolic. She also has hyperlipidemia on atorvastatin and peripheral vascular disease with associated leg and foot discomfort. She reports ongoing peripheral neuropathy symptoms, including foot numbness and pain radiating to the hips, which limit her walking. She continues to smoke and is not ready to quit. She reports occasional cough due to congestion but denies fever, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, or GI symptoms. Urinary symptoms include a slower stream and nocturia.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM:\nVital signs: Blood pressure 140/60 mm Hg. Cardiovascular exam reveals regular rhythm, no murmurs. Pulmonary exam shows clear lungs with no wheezes or rales. Extremities are without edema; pulses are palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial arteries. Skin shows mild dryness and thickened nails. Neurological exam indicates mildly decreased sensation in the tips of the first and second toes. No skin breakdown observed.\n\nRESULTS:\nRecent HbA1c was 9.9. Blood pressure at the visit was 140/60 mm Hg. Lung auscultation was clear. No edema or skin breakdown noted. Pulses are palpable. Sensory exam shows mild peripheral neuropathy. Blood work to be rechecked today, including kidney function and lipid profile.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\n- Diabetes Mellitus: Poorly controlled (HbA1c 9.9). Increase glimepiride to 4 mg twice daily, starting with current supply of 2 mg tablets (take two tablets twice daily). Continue metformin. Educate patient on signs of hypoglycemia.\n- Hypertension: Continue current medications (metoprolol 50 mg daily, lisinopril with hydrochlorothiazide 20/25 mg daily, amlodipine 10 mg daily). Recheck blood pressure and kidney function today.\n- Hyperlipidemia: Continue atorvastatin. Reinforce adherence.\n- Peripheral Neuropathy: Mild symptoms present. Recommend moisturizing feet and consider topical treatments if symptoms worsen.\n- Vascular Disease: Continue walking as tolerated.\n- Smoking: Counsel on quitting; patient not ready but encouraged to consider cessation.\n- Other: No new symptoms of chest pain, shortness of breath, or GI issues. Recent eye exam with new glasses; cataract surgery was performed with some dissatisfaction with lens. Possible laser correction discussed if needed.\n- Follow-up: Labs to be reviewed today. Return in four months for follow-up. Patient advised to monitor for hypoglycemia and report any concerning symptoms.\n</response>\nThe reference note will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nCHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nFollow-up for diabetes management, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, peripheral vascular disease.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nMaria Martin is a 75-year-old female who presents today for follow-up for diabetes.\n\nThe patient\u2019s blood glucose levels are poorly controlled and her most recent hemoglobin A1C is 9.9%. She denies increasing glimepiride to 4 mg twice a day as advised but confirms she is compliant with 2 mg twice a day. She mostly denies reducing sugar and carbohydrate intake, although she opts for wheat bread, she does not have pasta at home, and she does not drink much soda and instead drinks club soda or seltzer water. She reports that her diabetic eye exams are up to date and she follows with Dr. Sanchez at Optimum Optometrists. She recently underwent cataract surgery and received a new prescription for her glasses, noting improvement in her vision to one eye and displeasure with the lens in her other eye.\n\nShe confirms compliancy with her blood pressure medications of metoprolol 50 mg daily, lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide 20/25 mg daily, and amlodipine 10 mg daily. The patient intermittently completes at home blood pressure checks and reported seeing a systolic BP of 116 a few weeks ago. She is also compliant with her atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia and reports tolerating it well.\n\nThe patient is still experiencing bilateral hip, thigh, and foot pain related to peripheral neuropathy, noting her mobility is limited but she is walking as tolerated.\n\nMs. Martin does continue to smoke cigarettes and denies interest in cessation, although she agreed to begin thinking about it.\n\nShe is currently experiencing a productive cough with clear sputum that she attributes to her recent congestion.\n\nThe patient is also experiencing a slower urine stream, but it appears stable, and she contributes her urinary symptoms to aging. She also has nocturia on occasion which she contributes to her increased fluid intake in the evenings.\n\nPAST HISTORY\n\nMedical\nType 2 diabetes mellitus.\nHypertension.\nHyperlipidemia.\nPeripheral vascular disease with neuropathy.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nCurrent tobacco smoker.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS\n\nMetoprolol 50 mg tablet. Take 1 tablet daily.\nLisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide 20/25 mg tablet. Take 1 tablet daily.\nAmlodipine 10 mg tablet. Take 1 tablet daily.\nAtorvastatin tablet.\nMetformin.\nGlimepiride 4mg tablet. Take 2 tablets by oral route 2 times per day.\n\nVITALS\n\nBlood pressure 140/60.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nRespiratory\nNo rasping, wheezing.\n\nCardiovascular\nNormal heart rate and regular rhythm. Carotids and pulses are normal. S1 and S2 are crisp. No murmurs.\n\nGastrointestinal\nNo nausea or vomiting.\n\nExtremities\nBilateral Diabetic Foot Exam: No edema with palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses bilaterally. No skin breakdown. Thickened nails.\nSensory Examination: Mildly decreased sensation in the tips of the first and second toes bilaterally.\n\nRESULTS\n\nHemoglobin A1C 9.9%.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\n\u2022 Type 2 diabetes mellitus.\n\u2022 Hypertension.\n\u2022 Hyperlipidemia.\n\u2022 Peripheral vascular disease.\n\nPLAN\n\nType 2 diabetes mellitus\nIncrease glimepiride to 4 mg tablets two times per day. I counselled patient on the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia, although I don\u2019t think she is at a great risk of hypoglycemia. There will be no change to her metformin dose. I counselled the patient on limiting her carbohydrate intake to support improved glycemia. We will recheck her Hemoglobin A1c and complete a kidney function test today.\n\nPeripheral vascular disease\nI counselled patient on improving frequency of moisturizing her feet. Improved glycemia would also benefit her neuropathy. If symptoms worsen, we will consider medication to control symptoms, but not at this time due to the patient has already reached polypharmacy.\n\nHypertension\nBlood pressure appears to be well controlled based on checks completed at home. The patient will continue with amlodipine, metoprolol, and lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide.\n\nHyperlipidemia\nI will continue with atorvastatin as previously prescribed. If patient were to improve her diet, this would likely be beneficial as well.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nFinish current prescription of glimepiride 2 mg, 2 tablets 2 times per day. Refill will be 4 mg tablet, 1 tablet 2 times per day. Reduce carbohydrate intake overall to improve glycemia. Call the office with questions or any signs or symptoms of hypoglycemia.\n\n</gold_response>\nCarefully review the <response> based on the <conversation> and compare it to the <gold_response> when needed.\n\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Does the note provide correct clinical information based on the conversation?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the note include all important medical details from the conversation?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the note written clearly and organized in a standard clinical format for clinicians\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

The symptoms began after a car accident in December where he sustained wrist fractures; he reports wearing splints on both wrists, with the right being worse. He describes the numbness and tingling as extending from the middle and ring fingers up the forearms, more prominent at night and intermittent during the day. He also reports soreness and occasional throbbing in the hands, with a sensation of weakness, especially during use. Additionally, he has mild neck stiffness following a head contusion from the same accident. No loss of sensation has been noted, but he perceives decreased sensitivity. He has been prescribed nerve pain medication but has not been consistent with use.\n\n**PHYSICAL EXAM:**  \nVital signs and general appearance are unremarkable. Neurologic exam reveals decreased sensation to pinprick in the third and fourth fingers on the right and the fourth and fifth fingers on the left. Reflexes are 1+ and symmetric; knee reflexes are 2+, and toes are downgoing bilaterally. Tinel sign is positive at both wrists and elbows, indicating nerve irritation. No other abnormalities noted on physical exam.\n\n**RESULTS:**  \nSensory testing shows diminished sensation in the specified fingers. Reflex testing is normal. Tinel sign is positive bilaterally at wrists and elbows, suggesting nerve compression. No other significant findings on exam.\n\n**ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:**  \nThe clinical presentation suggests bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, possibly with some contribution from cubital tunnel syndrome, likely related to prior trauma. An EMG study will be scheduled to localize nerve irritation. The patient will continue wearing wrist splints and will follow up after EMG results. Depending on the findings, treatment options may include conservative management, injections, or surgical release. Referral to a hand specialist or orthopedist may be considered if symptoms persist. The patient is advised to monitor symptoms and adhere to current splint use.",

He continues to wear a splint on the right wrist all the time and on the left only intermittently, which he states is because the right wrist was injured more severely in the accident. The sensation radiates from the hands into the forearms and is equal bilaterally. The 4th and 5th fingers in the left hand and 3rd and 4th on the right-hand tingle. He states that his fingers are sore with palpation and seem weaker than before. Any exertion exacerbates the tingling, and after something exacerbates the pain, the tingling seems \"dull\". The symptoms come and go and seem to occur mostly at night. He denies complete loss of sensation in any of his fingers, but states that they seem less sensitive than they should be. He reports mild stiffness in his neck. He notes that he did hit his head during the car accident and was diagnosed with a contusion. He states that he has been given \"nerve pain medicine\u201d but has not been taking it.\n\nHe currently takes Coreg for his hypertension and Lexapro for his anxiety. He reports a history of prediabetes, which he has brought under control via dietary changes. He denies any history of thyroid issues.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\n\u2022 Constitutional Symptoms: Easily fatigued, weight gain.\n\u2022 Eyes: Floaters.\n\u2022 Cardiovascular: Bilateral peripheral edema.\n\u2022 Respiratory: Shortness of breath.\n\u2022 Gastrointestinal: Excessive appetite, abdominal bloating.\n\u2022 Musculoskeletal: Gout, muscle pain.\n\u2022 Integumentary: Dry itchy skin, nail bed changes.\n\u2022 Endocrine: Excessive hunger.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nNeurological\nPinprick sensation intact in the 3rd and 4th fingers on the right hand and 4th and 5th fingers on the left hand. Reflexes are 1+ and symmetric, 2+ knees. Toes down going bilaterally. Tinel\u2019s sign positive at both wrists and elbows.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\n\u2022 Bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome\nMr. Cook is a 60-year-old male referred today for evaluation of numbness and tingling of both hands. His symptom presentation and exam findings today suggest this is bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome or, potentially, this could also be bilateral cubital tunnel syndrome.\n\nPLAN\n\nDiagnosis discussed with patient, I explained that the nerves in his wrists are aggravated by the past trauma causing the pain and tingling.

She reports the symptoms began after a car accident in December where she sustained wrist fractures and a head contusion. She notices the numbness and tingling primarily in the middle and ring fingers on the right, extending up to the forearm, and in the pinky, ring, and sometimes middle fingers on the left. The symptoms are worse at night and fluctuate during the day. She describes the sensation as mainly soreness and occasional throbbing, with feelings of weakness, especially during activity. She denies significant loss of sensation but notes decreased sensitivity. She reports mild neck stiffness and has been wearing wrist splints, which provide some relief. No recent trauma or other neurological symptoms are reported.\n\n**PHYSICAL EXAM:**  \nVital signs and general appearance are not specified. Neurological exam reveals normal sensation except for diminished pinprick sensation in the third and fourth fingers on the right and the fourth and fifth fingers on the left. Reflexes are 1+ and symmetric at the knees and ankles. Tinel's sign is positive at both wrists and elbows, indicating nerve compression.

She continues to wear a splint on the right wrist all the time and on the left only intermittently, which she states is because the right wrist was injured more severely in the MVA. The sensation radiates from the hands into the forearms and is equal bilaterally. The 4th and 5th fingers in the left hand and 3rd and 4th on the right-hand tingle. She states that her fingers are sore with palpation and seem weaker than before. Any exertion exacerbates the tingling, and after something exacerbates the pain, the tingling seems \"dull\". The symptoms come and go and seem to occur mostly at night. She denies complete loss of sensation in any of her fingers, but states that they seem less sensitive than they should be. she reports mild stiffness in her neck. She notes that she did hit her head during the MVA and was diagnosed with a contusion. She states that she has been given \"nerve pain medicine\u201d but has not been taking it.\n\nThe patient takes carvedilol for her hypertension and Lexapro for her anxiety. She reports a history of prediabetes, which she has brought under control via dietary changes. She denies any history of thyroid issues.\n\nREVIEW OF SYMPTOMS\n\n\u2022 Constitutional Symptoms: The patient reports increased fatigue and weight gain.\n\u2022 Eyes: Positive for floaters.\n\u2022 Cardiovascular: Positive for leg swelling.\n\u2022 Respiratory: Positive for shortness of breath.\n\u2022 Gastrointestinal: Positive for excessive hunger and bloating.\n\u2022 Musculoskeletal: Positive for gout and muscle pain.\n\u2022 Integumentary: Positive for nail bed changes, dryness, and itching.\n\u2022 Neurological: Positive for bilateral paresthesia of hands.\n\u2022 Endocrine: Positive prediabetes and excessive hunger.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY\n\nChronic kidney disease (CKD).\nPrediabetes, diet controlled.\nHypertension.\nGastric esophageal reflux disorder (GERD)\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS\n\nCarvedilol 25 mg twice daily.\nLexapro 10 mg daily.\n\nALLERGIES\n\nSulfa, causes rash.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nNeurological Exam\nSensation is normal except pinprick sensation diminished in the 3rd and 4th fingers on the right and the 4th and 5th fingers on the left. 1+ and symmetric, 2+ knees.

Patients are instructed to contact the office if symptoms worsen or if any new concerns arise before the scheduled follow-up.\n</response>\nThe reference note will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nCHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nAcid reflux.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nMichelle King is a 35 y.o. female who presents to clinic today for a new patient evaluation of acid reflux. She was referred by her primary care physician, Dr. Scott.\n\nThe patient reports severe acid reflux that has increased in severity in recent years. She explains that she has struggled with acid reflux since approximately age 12 and she describes a burning sensation in her chest that travels up her esophagus. She denies any dysphagia, abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, changes in bowel movements, constipation, diarrhea, and rectal bleeding. She also denies any unintentional weight loss, although she admits to having a poor appetite due to her being under immense stress for the past 2 months. She has identified triggers for her symptoms, including stress, spicy foods, soda, and citrus or tomato-based products. She admits that she does still eat her trigger foods sometimes despite the exacerbation of her symptoms.\n\nMs. King has been taking omeprazole 40 mg twice daily for approximately 1 year. She believes that the use of omeprazole provides some relief of her symptoms as there are some days when she is asymptomatic. The only other medication she has tried is ranitidine which she took concurrently with omeprazole and she believes this helped. The patient denies undergoing an EGD within the last 10 years.\n\nPAST HISTORY\n\nMedical\nAnxiety.\n\nSurgical\nSurgery as an infant for \u201ctwisted intestines.\u201d\n\nProcedures\nPossible EGD in youth, but none in the last 10 years.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nWorks as a paralegal.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY\n\nMaternal grandmother with esophageal cancer.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS\n\nOmeprazole 40 mg twice daily.\n\nALLERGIES\n\nSeasonal environmental allergies.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\n\u2022\u202fConstitutional Symptoms:\u202f Positive for loss of appetite.\n\u2022\u202fGastrointestinal:\u202fNegative for constipation, diarrhea, abdominal pain, difficulty swallowing, nausea, vomiting, blood in stools, unexplained change in bowel habits. Positive for heartburn.\n\u2022\u202fPsychiatric:\u202f Positive for stress and anxiety.\n\u2022\u202fAllergic/Immunologic:\u202f Positive for seasonal allergies.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nGastrointestinal\nThere is a well-healed abdominal surgical scar.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nThe patient presents today with a several year history of GERD that primarily manifests as heartburn and has been poorly controlled with omeprazole 40 mg twice daily. I suspect that she likely has GERD with underlying functional etiology as well. Reassuringly, she has no unintentional weight loss and denies any dysphagia. The patient has been able to identify triggers of her symptoms, including stress, spicy foods, carbonated beverages, citrus, and tomato-based foods.\n\n\u2022 GERD\n\u2022 Suspected underlying functional etiology of heartburn.\n\nPLAN\n\n\u2022 I recommended dietary and lifestyle modifications like cutting out her known trigger foods and trying to reduce her stress levels to help with her symptoms.\n\u2022 I prescribed Nexium 40 mg twice daily to replace her current omeprazole 40 mg twice daily. I sent this prescription to her pharmacy.\n\u2022 I also recommended she undergo an EGD. We discussed the potential risks of an endoscopic procedure. The patient understands the risks and is agreeable with the plan. She scheduled this procedure today.\n\u2022 If her EGD is normal and her symptoms persist despite a trial of Nexium, we can consider a trial of Protonix and obtain a pH impedance study. This will allow us to rule out abnormal acid reflux exposure and to decipher between a functional etiology and hypersensitivity.\n\u2022 The patient was counselled to call my office if anything changes or if she has any problems before her EGD or follow-up appointment.\n\u2022 She will follow up with me in clinic after her EGD to discussed results and provide an update on the Nexium.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\n\u2022 Avoid trigger foods and try to reduce stress levels.\n\u2022 Stop omeprazole 40 mg twice daily and start Nexium 40 mg twice daily instead.\n\u2022 Schedule EGD.\n\u2022 Call with any changes or problems.\n\u2022 Schedule a follow up visit after the EGD.\n</gold_response>\nCarefully review the <response> based on the <conversation> and compare it to the <gold_response> when needed.\n\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Does the note provide correct clinical information based on the conversation?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the note include all important medical details from the conversation?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the note written clearly and organized in a standard clinical format for clinicians\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

    "predicted_text": "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:\nMichelle King is a 39-year-old female with a history of quadriplegia due to prior spinal cord injury. She reports experiencing increasing concerns for spasms, lightheadedness, significant constipation, and diaphoresis. She was recently hospitalized from 06/29/2021 to 07/02/2021 at District Regional Hospital for fever, elevated WBC count (23,000), and symptoms suggestive of infection, initially thought to be a urinary tract infection. She believes her symptoms were primarily due to severe constipation and dysreflexia rather than infection, noting that her bowel movements improved after a large bowel movement at home. She denies current symptoms of infection or urinary issues and reports feeling back to her baseline. She also expresses hesitancy regarding COVID-19 vaccination, citing concerns about side effects and vaccine injury, but acknowledges understanding the importance of vaccination.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM:\nVital signs were stable with no current abnormalities. The patient appeared well and in no distress. Lung auscultation was clear, and no pain or discomfort was noted. Abdominal exam was unremarkable, with no tenderness or distension. Bowel sounds were normal. No signs of active infection or other acute findings were observed.\n\nRESULTS:\nRecent labs included a review of prior cultures and WBC counts, which had been mildly elevated previously. No recent imaging beyond X-ray was performed; prior evaluation did not reveal ongoing infection. The patient\u2019s white blood cell count was elevated during hospitalization but has since normalized or is expected to normalize with time and management. Urine cultures obtained during hospitalization showed no significant growth. No recent lab results are available at this visit, but plans include repeat CBC and comprehensive blood work in 2-3 weeks to monitor WBC levels and assess for ongoing inflammation or infection.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\n1. Acute to chronic constipation: Likely related to bowel dysreflexia and dehydration, especially during hot weather. Continue current bowel regimen with daily Miralax and lactulose as needed. Educate on hydration, especially during hot and humid conditions. Plan to repeat fasting labs, including CBC and lipid panel, in 2-3 weeks to monitor WBC count and overall health.\n2. Quadriplegia: Chronic condition with episodes of autonomic dysreflexia potentially triggered by constipation. No current acute issues.\n3. COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy: Discussed the importance of vaccination given her high-risk status due to quadriplegia. She remains hesitant but is open to further discussion. Emphasized that vaccination is the most effective preventative measure against COVID-19, with rare side effects. Encouraged her to consider vaccination and to make an informed decision.\n4. Follow-up: Return in 2-3 weeks for repeat labs and ongoing management. Patient advised to seek medical attention if symptoms of infection, worsening constipation, or new concerns arise.",

concerns for spasms and lightheadedness , significant constipation , and reported diaphoresis . she was evaluated in the emergency department where she was , uh , febrile and had significantly elevated white blood cell count of 23,000 . there were concerns for ongoing urinary tract infection , but she was treated with iv antibiotic therapy . she had labile blood pressure , headache , and vomiting . in the end , she slowly improved . she does have a supra-pubic catheter . cultures were obtained and reviewed . she was eventually discharged after clinical improvement of her symptoms . she presents today to follow up regarding these concerns . hi , michelle . how are you doing ?\n[patient] not too bad . and yourself ?\n[doctor] i'm good , thanks . so , it looks like you had an infection , right ?\n[patient] yeah . but you know , i really do n't think it was a uti .\n[doctor] okay .\n[patient] i told them when i went to the er ... is that your phone ?\n[doctor] it is , yeah . it listens to you and me and it does all of my documentation . it's pretty good stuff . um , tell me what's going on .\n[patient] it is , in my humble opinion , that i was just constipated and that was what was causing my blood pressure to be so high . and i hardly pooped when i was there . then when i got home i had a massive poop and i felt much better . i told them that when i was admitted , and they did x-rays and everything , but they said , \" no , \" as they did n't think that was n't ... that was it . but you know , i felt so much better when i got home and finally pooped .\n[doctor] okay . um , and the white cell count was the only thing that i think they were kind of concerned about because it was a little high .\n[patient] so i wondered if automatic dysreflexia can affect the white count ?\n[doctor] typically , it does n't .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] but , i mean , when i looked at the urine cultures that they checked , the cultures are not very impressive .\n[patient] yeah , that's what they said .\n[doctor] and when i go back and look , sometimes your white count is just elevated a little bit , and last year it was normal , so ...\n[patient] hm .\n[doctor] but in saying that , you know , inflammation can do that . so , yeah , you could be backed up and inflamed .\n[patient] yeah .\n[doctor] uh , they did n't do a cat scan , they just did an x-ray . but you feel like you're back to your normal self now ?\n[patient] yeah . i mean , i went in because i knew my blood pressure was out of control .\n[doctor] mm-hmm .\n[patient] it was giving me a headache and making me throw up . and i know , at that point , i'm at the loss of what i can do at home .\n[doctor] yeah , it was good that you went in .\n[patient] so i went in and they made me feel better , and then i went home , as you know .\n[doctor] well , maybe that's all it was .\n[patient] yeah .\n[doctor] so you're doing good otherwise ?\n[patient] yes , i am .\n[doctor] good . let me take a quick listen to you .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] all right . go ahead and take a few deep breaths . and breathe normally . now take several deep breaths . and two more . okay , good . you can relax . any pain or discomfort anywhere ?\n[patient] nope .\n[doctor] great . so here are my thoughts .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] you may recall it was extremely hot during that period leading up to you going to the hospital . i do n't know if you were inside for the most part ?\n[patient] yeah , it was pretty hot , was n't it ? and i go out a bit , but i do tend to stay in more when it's hot .\n[doctor] okay . well , if you do get dehydrated even just a little bit it can lead to further , um , or worsening constipation issues .\n[patient] mm-hmm .\n[doctor] i've had a lot of patients over the last couple of weeks coming in with just weird stuff , and i blame that a little bit on how hot and humid it was the last two weeks of june . so what i would do is wait a couple of weeks and then , if you could , come back in and we could do some , uh , complete blood work , uh , including your white blood cells and a full panel of cholesterol , since it's been a while .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] and it should normalize , but it's too soon to do it now . um , but maybe if i put some labs in you could come in in two to three weeks ?\n[patient] sure , i can do that .\n[doctor] great . so that appointment will let us kill a bird ... two birds with one stone since you're due to get blood work anyways for cholesterol .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] and then , i just wanted to make sure that the white count is okay , because if it remains elevated then that means there's something else going on with your bowels .\n[patient] mm-hmm .\n[doctor] i do n't think that's what we'll find , but we'll see .\n[patient] i mean , i knew going in that i had n't had a regular bowel movement in a while , even though i drink the miralax every day .\n[doctor] yeah .\n[patient] when i do n't go , i double up on that .\n[doctor] have i ever given you lactulose ? it would be a medicine you use in , um , conjunction with miralax . sort of a rescue type thing .\n[patient] is that the stuff that comes in a bottle ?\n[doctor] yes .\n[patient] then , yes . i have it . it takes about two days to work and then it's a brutal two days .\n[doctor] got it . yeah , it can be a little rough , but it works .\n[patient] yeah .\n[doctor] all right . so we have our plan . any questions ?\n[patient] yeah , well , i would like to talk to you about covid , if we can .\n[doctor] sure . so where are you at when it comes to the vaccine ?\n[patient] i am unvaccinated .\n[doctor] so what are your concerns about the vaccine ?\n[patient] well , we do n't know the side effects .\n[doctor] correct , we do n't .\n[patient] it's too soon to tell the side effects , and i'm hearing more and more reports of people getting what's now termed as \" vaccine injury \" .\n[doctor] right .\n[patient] which i had never heard of before . i do n't know if it is a new term or not , but my take on the whole thing is that i'm young and healthy enough to beat it , even if my respiratory is limited . i also take a lot of vitamin c.\n[doctor] okay .\n[patient] i also take multivitamins and i'm closely monitored . so i guess i do n't feel as though i really the vaccine .\n[doctor] well , my thoughts are that you actually should be vaccinated . i think you are high risk . if you get covid it's not going to be good for you .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] and i think it's safe . i mean , i understand and hear you . all of these stories out there about this , uh , regarding the vaccine . but i've seen all the bad things that could happen from covid . people have died in my practice , and i do n't disagree that if you got covid you'd probably be okay .\n[patient] yeah .\n[doctor] but i would consider you as someone that would make me a little bit concerned . i have had healthy people die from covid .\n[patient] mm-hmm .\n[doctor] i've had some people get really , really sick from it . so personally , i believe that this vaccine is completely safe . i really think that .\n[patient] all of them ?\n[doctor] yeah , i do , i do . i think there are side effects from all vaccines , so you have to go back and think about it . do you get flu shot every year ?\n[patient] no , i do n't .\n[doctor] right , well , it's hard for me to convince you because you're making a consistent viewpoint .\n[patient] well , i am open-minded to this .\n[doctor] mm-hmm . to me , it's , you know , a lot of the stuff out there is fear and most of us health providers have gotten the vaccine . we've seen what the virus can do . i also have gotten all of my kids vaccinated .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] so i'm not concerned about the side effects of this . i do n't think it does anything . um , and we have vaccinated 50 % of the country .\n[patient] mm-hmm .\n[doctor] the er is full of these vaccines .\n[patient] i understand .\n[doctor] so there are definitely potential side effects to the vaccine . i mean , there's guillain-barre , and all these things that could happen from the vaccine , but they're just very rare . my thing for you is i'm not convinced that there's alternative stuff or even the treatment we have , like the monoclonal antibodies , that will give help , but it's just my opinion .\n[patient] well , that's what i'm here for .\n[doctor] yeah . right now the numbers are low . even with the delta variant , when it starts mutating , it's actually good because it becomes more contagious , but less deadly .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] so that's what's gon na happen with covid . that's what's mo- most of the science supports and this is how most pandemics end , is that the virus starts losing its potency .\n[patient] sure .\n[doctor] but think about it , and if you have any more questions you can certainly let me know , okay ?\n[patient] will do .\n[doctor] all right . anything else we can discuss today ?\n[patient] nope . i think i'm all set . thank you .\n[doctor] you're welcome . so we'll see you in two to three weeks . have a good rest of your day .\n[patient] thanks , you too .\n[doctor] next line heading will be \" acute to chronic constipation \" . she believes her hospitalization was more likely due to her dysreflexia , from her quadriplegia that typically occurs . she did have a lot of vital signs changes , including blood pressure fluctuations . the patient feels like she has a good bowel regimen , including taking the miralax regularly as a primary treatment for constipation issues as well as lactulose for severe constipation . she feels like this was less likely a true urinary tract infection and was just related to her constipation . however , we did have a good discussion regarding her leukocytosis .\n[doctor] i would recommend just in the next three or four weeks to come back in for some updated fasting labs , and we'll repeat the cbc just to make sure her white blood cells tend downward . uh , next line and heading will be \" quadriplegia \" . um , next line and heading will be \" covid vaccine status \" . again , she's hesitant . we had a good discussion , and i recommended that the only true preventative mechanism for covid is the vaccine . i do not believe that supplements are necessarily going to help stave this off . i would be concerned if she does n't get the vaccine and i would consider her at high risk based on her quadriplegia status . she does not want to get covid . however , she needs to make these decisions . she is somewhat homeopathic .\n</conversation>\nThe generated note will be provided in these tags:\n<response>\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:\nMichelle King is a

She was admitted to District Regional Hospital on 06/29/2021 and discharged on 07/02/2021.\n\nThe patient has a history quadriplegia from a prior spinal cord injury. She reported an increased concern for spasms, lightheadedness, headaches, significant constipation, and diaphoresis. Due to her uncontrolled blood pressure, headaches, and vomiting, she was evaluated in the emergency department. She was noted to be febrile, had a significantly elevated white blood cell count of 23,000, and labile blood pressure. Cultures were obtained and reviewed, with a urinary tract infection suspected. To note, the patient does require use of a suprapubic catheter. She was provided IV antibiotic therapy and was discharged after clinical improvement of her symptoms.\n\nToday, the patient states she is feeling good and claims that she does not think she had an infection. Instead, she believes she was just constipated and that was the cause of her elevated blood pressure. She states she did not have a bowel movement in the hospital and when she got home, she had a large bowel movement and felt better. She states that she told the medical team in the emergency room that she was constipated, but they did not feel that was the causative agent, although they did complete x-rays and additional tests. The patient reports taking MiraLAX consistently for her constipation and Lactulose as needed, which takes 2 days produce a bowel movement.\n\nThe patient has not received the COVID-19 vaccinations because she does not know the side effects. She reports taking vitamin C and a multivitamin and she does not feel the need for the vaccine even though her \u201crespiratory status is limited\u201d. The patient also denies receiving the flu vaccine.\n\nPAST HISTORY\n\nMedical\nQuadriplegia.\nSpinal cord injury.\nHypertension.\nChronic constipation.\nAutomatic dysreflexia.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS\n\nMiraLAX as needed by mouth.\nLactulose as needed by mouth.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\n\u2022 Acute to chronic constipation.\n\u2022 Quadriplegia.\n\nPLAN\n\nAcute to chronic constipation\nShe believes that her hospitalization was more likely due to her constipation and dysreflexia from her quadriplegia. She had a lot of vital sign changes including blood pressure fluctuations. She feels like she has got a good bowel regimen. She does take MiraLAX consistently, and Lactulose for severe constipation. She feels like this was less likely a true urinary tract infection. However, we did have a good discussion regarding her leukocytosis. I would recommend in the next 3 or 4 weeks to come back in for some updated fasting labs and we will repeat the CBC and ensure that trends downwards.\n\nCOVID vaccine status\nAgain, she is hesitant. We had a good discussion. I recommend that the only real, true preventative mechanism for COVID is the vaccine. I do not believe that supplements are necessarily going to help stave this off. I would be concerned that she does not get vaccinated, I would consider her at high risk based on her quadriplegia status. She does not want to get COVID. However, she needs to make these decisions.

She initially presented with acute right-sided abdominal pain, described as severe and causing her to bend over, which was initially suspected to be appendicitis. She was treated for a stomach virus but symptoms worsened, prompting further testing. Ultrasound identified a small, atrophic right kidney with cysts, and she was found to have swelling of lymph nodes and signs of infection. She experienced persistent vomiting, pain, and burning sensation in her stomach, especially after eating certain foods or drinks. She reports no recent vomiting or urinary symptoms but notes occasional difficulty starting urination and burning when urinating, particularly with soda intake. Her past medical history includes multiple hospitalizations at age four for recurrent febrile illnesses, suspected to be related to kidney issues. She has a family history of kidney disease, including her father who had a renal transplant and died of a heart attack at 47, and her aunt with end-stage renal disease. Ashley has been taking Pepcid daily and has no other current medications.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM:\nOn examination, Ashley appears well-appearing, alert, and oriented, sitting comfortably without acute distress. Lung and heart auscultation are normal. No abnormalities noted on physical exam. Blood pressure is within normal limits. Abdominal exam reveals mild tenderness but no rebound or guarding. No edema or other significant findings.\n\nRESULTS:\nRecent ultrasound shows a small, atrophic right kidney with cystic changes; the left kidney appears compensatorily enlarged. Blood pressure is normal. Urinalysis is pending but no hematuria or proteinuria has been reported. Blood tests indicate normal kidney function at this time. Family history confirms hereditary kidney disease, with documentation of her father\u2019s prior renal failure and transplant, and her great-aunt\u2019s end-stage renal disease.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\nAshley is a healthy-appearing adolescent with a known small, atrophic right kidney and family history of hereditary kidney disease. Current physical exam and labs suggest preserved kidney function, but she remains at risk for hypertension and proteinuria. She will undergo annual monitoring with renal ultrasound, urinalysis, and blood pressure checks. She is advised to maintain adequate hydration (at least 2 liters/day), avoid NSAIDs, and continue a healthy diet and active lifestyle. She should avoid dehydration, especially during sports. Follow-up with her primary care provider or an adult nephrologist is recommended. No immediate intervention is necessary, but ongoing surveillance is essential to monitor renal function and prevent progression.",

these tags:\n<conversation>\nDoctor-patient dialogue:\n\n[doctor] okay . next patient is ashley james , date of birth 12/27/2006 . ashley is a 14-year-old female , uh , who was previously healthy , now here for evaluation of abnormal renal ultrasound with an atrophic right kidney . hi . good afternoon , ashley . how are you doing ?\n[patient] i'm doing okay . how are you .\n[doctor] i'm doing well . thanks so much for asking . i'm dr. rogers . i'm one of your kidney doctors . and you guys must be mom and dad .\n[patient] yes , that's correct .\n[doctor] great . well ... all right . it's so nice to meet all of you . i wish it was under better circumstances , but we're gon na figure it all out , uh , here today . um , speaking of that , let's go ahead and review some of your past medical history , and then i'll complete an exam of her heart and lungs and kind of move from there . would that be all right with you , ashley ?\n[patient] yeah , that sounds good .\n[doctor] okay . so as i understand it , ashley was found to have a small ... kind of a small kidney on one side . tell me about when that was . um , i do also have records of everything , but i'd just like to hear the story of how it was found out and what you're doing that got us here , uh , today .\n[patient_guest] sure . so ashley came home one day sick out of nowhere , rubbing her stomach , and she said it was hurting on her right side . and it was so bad that she was bent over in pain .\n[doctor] okay .\n[patient] we automatically thought appendix .\n[doctor] sure . that makes a lot of sense .\n[patient_guest] we took her to her doctor . they treated her for a stomach virus . they get her fluids and sent her back home , and the next day she was twice as bad as the first day .\n[doctor] goodness . okay . then what happened ?\n[patient_guest] yeah . so i took her back again and they did more testing . i think they did an ultrasound or something , and that's where they found that one kidney was bigger .\n[doctor] okay .\n[patient_guest] um , then at that time they told us to followup with our primary the next day , which we did . um , but he was heading out on vacation , so he only saw her for a brief 10 minutes and then we were out the door . so she was still throwing up , in a lot of pain , so i took work off to help her .\n[doctor] wow . okay .\n[patient_guest] uh , we took her down to jacksonville , where they did see her and basically told us the same thing , that they did n't think one of her kidneys was working at all . they called it atrophic and that it was a lot smaller than the other one .\n[doctor] all right-y . then- then what happened ?\n[patient_guest] yeah . then , um , they found cysts or something on her kidney and ovaries and maybe some other places . her lymph nodes were swollen and they found some infection . um , they told us to followup with her doctor , which we figured since she was still sick .\n[doctor] okay . and then when you followed up with your doctor , what happened then ?\n[patient_guest] yeah . it did n't seem to be getting any better within a day or two , so we followed back up with her doctor , who was , of course , still out of town with no one to see her in his place . so we ended up coming to atlanta . we stayed here for about four days . um , they did see her and treated her .\n[doctor] okay . i am so sorry for all of that back and forth , but glad to know that there was some light at the end of that tunnel .\n[patient_guest] thank you . and then after they saw her , she did seem to get a little better . she has n't had any more throwing up or anything since , but she still complains about a lot of pain in her stomach .\n[doctor] mhm . okay .\n[patient_guest] yeah . and she mentions burning too , especially when she eats and stuff like that .\n[doctor] all right-y . okay . well , that was a really good review . so , ashley , before all of this , would you say that , all in all , you were a pretty healthy child ?\n[patient_guest] she is , yeah . before that , she was completely fine . uh , they said they think at some point she had a severe infection that might've affected her kidney .\n[doctor] got you . okay .\n[patient_guest] so one other thing , too , um , when she was four years old she was in the hospital three or four times , sometimes for three days at a time . i do n't think they did any tests to see what the infection was or even where it was coming from . um , they just gave her fluids and antibiotic and they would send us home .\n[doctor] hmm . okay .\n[patient_guest] yeah . and so a week or two later , she would have a fever and symptoms and basically the same thing . we went through that for a couple of months , and then it just stopped . so she had no problem since , but the doctor suspects that she's had kidney problems since then . so we just wan na see if she's all right or if she ... if it needs to be taken out maybe . we wan na do whatever needs to be done .\n[doctor] yes . absolutely . it sounds like this road has been very much so rough to navigate too , so we'll- we'll get you through for that . um , is ashley taking any medications daily right now ?\n[patient_guest] only pepcid .\n[doctor] okay .\n[patient_guest] yeah . so she takes 40 milligrams of pepcid a day and then also takes claritin for allergies .\n[doctor] all right-y . and any difficulties with your pregnancy with her or during delivery ?\n[patient_guest] no . um , renal disease does run in my family , though . my dad , aunt , and my cousins all have issues with their kidneys . i have their paperwork right here for you with their diagnoses .\n[doctor] great . i will definitely review that over . any other , uh , family history to be aware of ?\n[patient_guest] yes . my mom had breast cancer too .\n[doctor] okay . great . all right-y . so just a ... over a quick review . it does look like your- your father had a kidney transplant . is that correct ?\n[patient_guest] yes , that is correct . he did .\n[doctor] okay . so obstructive neuropathy . uh , it sounds like he was born with it and something , uh ... something made it so he could n't urinate correctly . does that sound right ?\n[patient_guest] yes , and they did n't catch it in time .\n[doctor] i'm so sorry to hear that .\n[patient_guest] yeah . he actually died at 47 of a massive heart attack .\n[doctor] my goodness . wow . i am so sorry to hear that , um , but thank you so much for ... you know , all of these bits and pieces really help knit up a story together for ashley so we can get her the best care .\n[patient_guest] you're welcome .\n[doctor] okay . so you said her aunt also has had kidney disease ?\n[patient_guest] yes . well , it was my dad's sister , so her great aunt .\n[doctor] okay . and ... okay . i'm looking here . it looks like ... do you know what the name of diagnosis ? it does n't seem to be mentioned .\n[patient_guest] um , this is what she sent me , \" end-stage renal disease . chronic kidney disease stage five , diabetes , hypertension . \" that's all i have , uh , to work on for her .\n[doctor] okay . uh , and that's ... okay . let me see . that is all when ... she was an adult when all of that happened ?\n[patient_guest] correct . yep .\n[doctor] all right-y . okay . and it also looks like ashley has seen a gi and a geneticist , where they did n't find anything sig ... clinically significant mutations on the panel that they did .\n[patient_guest] yes .\n[doctor] okay . so that's all good . so , ashley , um , a few questions for you if that's all right . how are you feeling right now ?\n[patient] i'm not feeling too bad . my stomach just hurts just a little bit . it's burning a little bit .\n[doctor] okay . and any pain when you go pee ?\n[patient] sometimes it's just hard to start , sometimes .\n[doctor] okay . and any blood in your pee ?\n[patient] no , not that i've noticed .\n[doctor] okay .\n[patient_guest] she does complain that it burns when she pees when she drinks certain drinks , um , like , soda . so she'll only drink gatorade or water .\n[doctor] okay . yeah . so we do see that some people are very sensitive when the drink certain items , especially the carbonation . um , it can make it burn a little bit when they urinate . um ... okay . so a lot of different pictures of her kidneys here , and we'll review all of that here in a moment . um-\n[patient_guest] okay .\n[doctor] all right-y . but before we review that , i wan na look through a quick exam , uh , and just see how things are doing . you'll hear me speak aloud the exam just to make sure i'm getting everything documented .\n[patient_guest] okay .\n[doctor] all right-y . please use my physical exam template . so , ashley , i'm gon na listen to your lungs and heart , if you'll just breathe normally for me . okay ?\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] good . lungs and heart sound great . all right-y . so your physical exam , you know , everything we see up here is ... you know , you're a well-appearing female , alert and oriented , sitting comfortably on my chair today , i hope , uh , with not acute distress . exam , um , otherwise with norm ... within normal limits . okay . so where does that all leave us ? the good news is that her kidney functions do look good as- as does her blood pressure . we'll wan na keep on eye on both of those things , as she is at a higher risk for developing high blood pressure and something that we call proteinuria , which is where your kidneys do n't work as well as they should and we end of seeing protein in your pee .\n[patient_guest] okay .\n[doctor] or , excuse me , her pee . uh , her right kidney is a little bit smaller which is making her left kidney work harder , possibly causing the left to appear bigger , um , and it's something that we wan na keep an eye on but nothing for us to do with anything today .\n[patient_guest] okay . thank you .\n[doctor] i also recommend that , on an annual basis , we do kind of the following things . so i wan na have an ultrasound to monitor the size of her kidneys and their overall function , complete a urinalysis to continue to make sure that protein and blood are not in her ... in her pee , and do a blood pressure check . additionally , let's avoid non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines like ibuprofen and opt to use tylenol instead .\n[patient_guest] okay . that sounds good .\n[doctor] okay . and does ashley play any sports ?\n[patient_guest] yes . she is active in softball and she wants to join the drill team over the summer .\n[doctor] how fun . i used to play softball back in the day . um , so it'll be very important that during those activities she stays well-hydrated . i really wan na avoid dehydration , as it puts tremendous strain on her kidneys . so i'm gon na recommend at least two liters per day of water .\n[patient_guest] okay . great . we will work on that .\n[doctor] okay . i also recommended a healthy diet and continue her active lifestyle . this will help keep her and her kidneys healthier as an adult . so if we can start those behaviors early , we'll be in a good space as she progresses .\n[patient_guest] we can do that . we already do try to eat , uh , very well .\n[doctor] good . good . so for her next appointment , she can either meet with her primary care physician or an adult nephrologist closer to you guys at home . you do n't have come all the way out here .\n[patient_guest] okay . that sounds great .\n[doctor] okay . that was a lot . do we need any additional questions clarified or anything ? um , you can always give us or your primary a call if you think of anything or if ... certainly , if symptoms worse .\n[patient_guest] no . i do n't have any additional questions , and i'll- i'll definitely give you a- a phone call if we do . and thank you so much . this was so helpful .\n[doctor] awesome . well , thank you guys for making the trip . and , ashley , it was really nice to meet you . mom dad , you as well . and i hope you guys take care .\n[patient_guest] you too .\n[doctor] all right-y . past medical history , review of patient's grandfather's record , we see he had posterior urethral bowels valves and obstructive neur- neuropathy . uh , he developed chronic kidney disease and was on dial ... was dialysis-dependent . he had a renal transplant which subsequently failed , died of dialysis in his 40s . , wait . is that right ?\n[patient_guest] now that you've started , it does ... i do n't understand the he unless they were giving ... , the grandfather's record . but did you wan na do this on your own this recording ?\n[doctor] yeah . that's ... yeah . that'll work 'cause i'm gon na have to drop for this . but i think we're good for everything else .\n[patient] and he did die in his 40s . that's what it said in the note earlier .\n[doctor] okay . yeah . he died in his 40s , but i thought it was from a massive heart attack . died at 47 of a massive heart-\n[patient] he died ... it- it's saying that it meant ... it means he died on dia ... like , he was ... he was , um , utilizing dialysis .\n[doctor] not because

Her parents brought her for evaluation, and they treated her for a stomach virus and administered fluids prior to sending her home. The next day, the patient's pain was more severe. The patient returned to the doctor's office and an ultrasound and additional testing was performed which revealed left kidney hypertrophy. At that time, they were encouraged to follow-up with her primary care physician. The patient was seen briefly by her physician the next day, which was insignificant. Ashley was still experiencing stomach pain and vomiting, her father brought her to another facility in Jacksonville. At that location, the patient's family received information that her right kidney was nonfunctioning, atrophic, and smaller than her left kidney. Additionally, cysts on her kidneys, ovaries, and other locations were found. Her lymph nodes were swollen, and she had \"a lot of infections\". The patient was sent back to follow-up with her primary care physician. The patient was unable to follow back up with her primary care physician as he was still out of town. The patient came to Atlanta, remained here for 4 days, was evaluated and treated with subsequent improvement of her symptoms. She has not vomited since.\n\nPrior to her current medical complaints, the patient was healthy. The etiology of her kidney issues is believed to have been caused by some severe infection the patient experienced, possibly as a child.\n\nWhen the patient was 4 years old, she was hospitalized 3 or 4 times, for up to 2-3 days each time. She received fluids and antibiotics, and then discharged. Her father reports that no workup was ever performed to rule out infections during these hospitalizations. A week or 2 post-discharge the fever and symptoms would return. This kept recurring for approximately 2 months and then it spontaneously resolved.\n\nThe patient is still experiencing some stomach burning. She reports hesitancy while urinating and she states she has to wait for her urinary flow to commence. She endorses occasional dysuria. Ashley denies hematuria. Some beverages are associated with dysuria, thus the patient drinks mainly water, Gatorade and V8 juice.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nThe patient plays on softball team and is interested in joining a drill team over the summer.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY\n\nPaternal Grandfather: Deceased approximately 47. Myocardial Infarction. Posterior Urethral Valves. Obstructive Neuropathy. End Stage Chronic Kidney Disease was Dialysis dependent. Failed Renal Transplant.\nPaternal Great Aunt: End Stage Chronic Kidney Disease is Dialysis dependent. Type II Diabetes. Hypertension.\n\nNo family history of polycystic kidney disease.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS\n\nPepcid 40 mg once daily.\nClaritin as needed for allergies.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nConstitutional\nWell-appearing female adolescent, sitting comfortably on the exam table in no acute distress.\n\nNeurological\nAlert.\n\nRESULTS\n\nAbdominal ultrasound, 03/22/2021.\nCT abdomen and pelvis, 03/22/2021.\nCMP, 03/22/2021.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\n\u2022 Renal hypoplasia.\nAshley is a 14-year-old female who presents today for evaluation of abnormal renal ultrasound with atrophic right kidney. She has right-sided renal hypoplasia with a small atrophic right kidney discovered incidentally on imaging for abdominal pain. Imaging shows compensatory hypertrophy of her left kidney. Otherwise, she shows no sequelae of chronic kidney disease and enjoys normal blood pressure. Her urinalysis is without sediment. She has normal kidney function with creatinine of 0.62, which equates to an estimated GFR of greater than 90 mL/min per 1.73 m\u00b2, and normal serum electrolytes and acid base status. Ashley is at higher risk of hypertension and proteinuria, which will need to be followed annually.\n\nPLAN\n\nYearly ultrasound to monitor the hypertrophic left kidney and atrophic right kidney. Also, on an annual basis I recommend completion of a urinalysis to assess for proteinuria and blood pressure checks. The patient should avoid use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications and use Tylenol for pain and fever. It is also recommended that she stay well hydrated, avoiding dehydration, especially while participating in sports, by consuming 2 L of water per day. I counseled the patient and family about the importance of a healthy diet and remaining active to avoid future comorbidities that may put her at increased risk for chronic kidney disease as in adult.\n\nThe patient does not need to follow up with a pediatric nephrologist but can instead follow up with her primary care physician or an adult nephrologist closer to home.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nSchedule follow up appointment with local adult nephrologist or primary care physician.\n</gold_response>\nCarefully review the <response> based on the <conversation> and compare it to the <gold_response> when needed.\n\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Does the note provide correct clinical information based on the conversation?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the note include all important medical details from the conversation?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the note written clearly and organized in a standard clinical format for clinicians\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

The note misattributes the family history to the patient's father rather than the grandfather (with posterior urethral valves, ESRD, failed transplant, death at 47 from MI). It states \"no recent vomiting or urinary symptoms\" yet also documents urinary hesitancy and dysuria, which is contradictory. It invents an abdominal exam finding of mild tenderness not supported by the conversation (exam was otherwise normal). It lists \"urinalysis is pending\" without basis in the dialogue. It also omits Claritin by stating \"no other current medications\" despite its use for allergies.

    "predicted_text": "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:\nSean presents with chronic left lower back pain, which has persisted since his back surgery in November 2020. He reports experiencing episodes of severe nerve pain down his leg prior to surgery, treated with high-dose gabapentin, which was difficult to discontinue. Currently, he describes the back pain as intermittent and worsened by physical activities such as bending over and weight-bearing. He notes that stretching provides relief. The pain is localized around the L5 region, with no associated leg numbness or weakness reported.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM:\nOn examination, Sean exhibits no pain with lumbar flexion or extension. Palpation reveals tenderness on the left side around the L5 area; no tenderness is noted on the right side. Motor strength is intact with normal dorsiflexion and no signs of nerve deficits. Standing pain is elicited upon palpation, but there is no radiating leg pain or sensory deficits.\n\nRESULTS:\nLumbar spine X-ray shows no fractures or hardware complications; surgical sites appear healed appropriately. No nerve impingement signs are evident clinically. The physical exam supports a musculoskeletal etiology rather than nerve injury or instability.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\nSean's back pain is likely due to muscle strain or muscular imbalance post-surgery. Management will include physical therapy to improve spinal support and flexibility. Pharmacologic treatment will be adjusted to meloxicam for better pain control, and a referral to pain management will be made to explore non-narcotic options. While the patient inquired about stronger analgesics such as Vicodin or Demerol, these will be prescribed cautiously, with a preference for non-opioid therapies. No further neurological deficits are noted. Follow-up will be scheduled to monitor response to therapy and adjust treatment as needed.",

back pain\n[patient] mm-hmm\n[doctor] does anything make it better or worse so my beautiful significant other always tells me to stretch and it always works\n[patient] she sounds smart\n[doctor] yeah she is so stretching helps okay what about any physical activities do they make it worse\n[patient] a lot of bending over\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] and\n[doctor] honestly it it just happens\n[patient] you know randomly\n[doctor] randomly okay so it hurt on the right side as well or just the left\n[patient] depends on the day\n[doctor] is it right around where you had surgery\n[patient] generally\n[doctor] okay did you try icing\n[patient] no\n[doctor] hmmm did you try any pain meds\n[patient] yep\n[doctor] what kind of pain meds did you\n[patient] ibuprofen eight hundred milligrams a day\n[doctor] it's quite a high dose okay let me do a quick physical exam on your back here if you bend forward does that hurt\n[patient] not right now but normally it would\n[doctor] okay so no pain with flexion how about if you stand back up\n[patient] no\n[doctor] okay no pain with extension either does it hurt while you're just standing here\n[patient] yes\n[doctor] okay so pain when you're weightbearing does it hurt when i push right here on the left side\n[patient] yes\n[doctor] pain with palpation to the left side around the l5 how about on the right side\n[patient] no\n[doctor] no pain with palpation to the right side okay i'm just gon na push down on your feet can you push back up on my hands\n[patient] yes\n[doctor] alright dorsiflexion is normal looks like that you have normal range of motion so that's good any pain down your legs\n[patient] no\n[doctor] great no nerve pain alright so we took an x-ray when you came in it looks like you do n't have any fractures or anything on the spinal bone that's good you can see where you had surgery it looks like everything has healed properly there so that's good news so what i think you did is you have a a muscle pull there from having a misalignment in your spine so what i'm gon na do is i'll prescribe some physical therapy for you you have great physical therapy here at the va so you can just come right to our physical therapist and that should help have you have you been there before\n[patient] yes\n[doctor] how do you feel about it\n[patient] i really go to the dentist\n[doctor] got it okay so i'm also gon na prescribe you some meloxicam instead of the ibuprofen that might help a little bit more with some of the pain management\n[patient] is there any chance i can get some vicodin\n[doctor] lem me check your record quick for for pain management it's kind of a strong drug for vicodin and we do n't really like to prescribe that unless it's totally necessary so why do n't we start with the meloxicam and i also write a referral to pain management and they can talk to you a little bit about some of your pain and maybe not using narcotics to manage it\n[patient] how about some demerol\n[doctor] hmmm sure i'll prescribe demerol\n[patient] thank you\n[doctor] yeah you're welcome any other problems going on today you want to talk about\n[patient] no\n[doctor] alright well it was nice to see you today\n[patient] it's always nice to see you as well\n[doctor] alright\n</conversation>\nThe generated note will be provided in these tags:\n<response>\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:\nSean presents with chronic left lower back pain, which has persisted since his back surgery in November 2020. He reports experiencing episodes of severe nerve pain down his leg prior to surgery, treated with high-dose gabapentin, which was difficult to discontinue. Currently, he describes the back pain as intermittent and worsened by physical activities such as bending over and weight-bearing. He notes that stretching provides relief. The pain is localized around the L5 region, with no associated leg numbness or weakness reported.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM:\nOn examination, Sean exhibits no pain with lumbar flexion or extension. Palpation reveals tenderness on the left side around the L5 area; no tenderness is noted on the right side. Motor strength is intact with normal dorsiflexion and no signs of nerve deficits. Standing pain is elicited upon palpation, but there is no radiating leg pain or sensory deficits.\n\nRESULTS:\nLumbar spine X-ray shows no fractures or hardware complications; surgical sites appear healed appropriately. No nerve impingement signs are evident clinically. The physical exam supports a musculoskeletal etiology rather than nerve injury or instability.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\nSean's back pain is likely due to muscle strain or muscular imbalance post-surgery. Management will include physical therapy to improve spinal support and flexibility. Pharmacologic treatment will be adjusted to meloxicam for better pain control, and a referral to pain management will be made to explore non-narcotic options. While the patient inquired about stronger analgesics such as Vicodin or Demerol, these will be prescribed cautiously, with a preference for non-opioid therapies. No further neurological deficits are noted. Follow-up will be scheduled to monitor response to therapy and adjust treatment as needed.\n</response>\nThe reference note will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nCHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nLow back pain, left side.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nSean Phillips is a pleasant 35-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of left-sided low back pain.\n\nThe patient has been experiencing pain in the left side of his low back, generally localized around the surgical site of his microdiscectomy performed in 11/2020, but occasionally into the right side as well. Other than spontaneous flare-ups, his pain is worsened with excessive spinal flexion. Stretching and ibuprofen 800 mg daily are helpful, but he denies having tried icing the area.\n\nSURGICAL HISTORY\n\nThe patient is status post lumbar microdiscectomy performed in 11/2020.\n\nMEDICATIONS\n\nThe patient reports that, prior to his microdiscectomy in 2020, he was taking high-dose gabapentin for severe nerve pain through his back and lower extremities. He is currently taking ibuprofen 800 mg daily.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nMusculoskeletal: Reports left-sided low back pain.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nMSK: Examination of the lumbar spine: No pain with flexion or extension. Pain with weight-bearing. Pain with palpation on the left side around L5. No pain with palpation on the right side. Dorsiflexion is normal. Normal range of motion. No nerve pain in his lower extremities.\n\nRESULTS\n\nX-ray images of the lumbar spine were obtained and reviewed in office today. These reveal no evidence of fracture or other abnormalities in the spine or vertebrae. His previous surgical site is visible and appears to have healed properly.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nLow back pain, left side.\n\nPLAN\n\nAfter reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I believe his symptoms are related to a muscle strain due to spinal misalignment. I recommend that we treat the patient conservatively with formal physical therapy and meloxicam. The patient requested a prescription for Vicodin and Demerol. I explained that Vicodin is a strong medication for this issue and that I would need to refer him to pain management for that, but I did provide him with a prescription for Demerol.\n</gold_response>\nCarefully review the <response> based on the <conversation> and compare it to the <gold_response> when needed.\n\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Does the note provide correct clinical information based on the conversation?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the note include all important medical details from the conversation?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the note written clearly and organized in a standard clinical format for clinicians\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

However, the note inaccurately hedges on opioid prescribing; in the conversation the clinician explicitly agreed to prescribe Demerol, whereas the note states opioids \"will be prescribed cautiously\" with a preference for non-opioids and does not clearly document that Demerol was prescribed.

anymore i was just going with that you you're coming in with sudden visual distortion and blurring of vision so i'll just you know i'll just say i'll just go ahead and go into this technician part so it looks like the technician noticed that you've been having a decrease in vision when reading and straight lines and your door frames have been looking crooked to you is that right\n[patient] it is yes\n[doctor] okay what kind of venture are we gon na go into do you do you have the the script or no it it just talks\n[patient] but it's it's not presenting like like how you're reading it like how you're talking about it is it kinda what i'm saying because like after that i'm supposed to say yeah whenever i take my husband out to like a nice restaurant i have trouble adjusting to those dim lights but i'm not really getting the question of like so what's causing it or where do you have this happening stuff like that so i'm a little confused\n[doctor] okay i mean i can just straight out follow the script just so we can kinda get it rolling so so i said so hi so it looks like the technician noticed that you've been having a decrease in vision when reading and straight lines in your door frames have been looking crooked to you\n[patient] yeah and whenever i take my husband out to a nice restaurant i have trouble adjusting to those dim lights\n[doctor] uh okay so do you have a favorite restaurant you like to go to\n[patient] i do mcdonalds is one of my favorite here in arlington\n[doctor] that sounds good what what do you what's your favorite there\n[patient] they have a great egg plant parmajon one of my favorite so i just go ahead and go with that\n[doctor] that sounds really nice very good\n[patient] it's just\n[doctor] yeah okay well so it looks like you're still smoking a pack of cigarettes a day\n[patient] yes i tried to stop smoking every now and then but it's still been hard to totally stop\n[doctor] okay and how is your blood pressure been doing are you keeping up with your medication\n[patient] i take my blood pressure when i can remember to do so\n[doctor] okay yeah it's really important to keep up with your blood pressure check that regularly i'm totally going off script and you know might want to keep a log of that as well and check your blood pressures regularly so okay well let me do a just a quick exam of your eyes if you can take off your glasses and just rest your chin on the chin rest okay so the anterior segment examination reveals posterior chamber intraocular lenses in both eyes right eye the cornea is clear no mvi pciol cup to disc is . two fundus examination of the right eye shows the retina to be attached three hundred and sixty degrees without any tears or holes or pe changes in the fovea posterior segment exam shows drusen in the macula thickening of the retina presence of subretinal fluid and exudates accumulation positive for hemorrhage left eye the cornea is clear no mvi cup to disc is . three or pe changes in the fovea no hemorrhage or subretinal fluid retina is attached okay so i reviewed the results of your diagnostic tests so for the oct so it shows drusen deposit and the retinal pigment epithelium subretinal fluid accumulation choroidal neovascular membrane can be visualized fluorescein angiography reveals focal areas of leakage in the right eye consistent with neurovascular age related macular degeneration so the diagnostic tests and the eye exam are really indicative of neovascular age related macular degeneration so this is advanced to a stage that usually leads to more severe vision loss and it really happens when those abnormal blood vessels start to grow beneath the retina and they will leak fluid and blood and hints the name wet amd and can create a large blind spot in the center of the visual field and this is really with the most common cause for severe loss of vision so my plan is to give you an injection of lucentes once a month it's injected into the vitreous portion of the eye after it's been numbed and injections are given regularly over a period of time it may slow the rate of vision decline or stop further vision loss but however the disease and loss it may also progress despite treatment do you have any questions\n[patient] i do not no that sounds great\n[doctor] okay\n</conversation>\nThe generated note will be provided in these tags:\n<response>\n**HISTORY

She describes the injury as a twisting of the ankle outward, with pain localized to the outer ankle. She reports difficulty walking and limping since the injury. She has taken Tylenol without relief and heard a crack at the time of injury. She also notes some tingling and numbness in her toes and other areas, and has experienced a fever coinciding with the pain.\n\n**PHYSICAL EXAM:**  \nVital signs are within normal limits, with a temperature of 98.6\u00b0F, blood pressure 118/77 mmHg, and heart rate 77 bpm. Examination of the right ankle reveals edema, erythema over the lateral malleolus, ecchymosis, and excoriations. Tenderness to palpation is noted over the lateral malleolus. There is decreased range of motion in flexion, extension, and rotation of the ankle. No injuries are observed in the knee or foot. The patient reports pain when pressure is applied to the lateral malleolus.\n\n**RESULTS:**  \nAn ankle X-ray was performed prior to examination, showing no evidence of fracture or bony abnormality. Soft tissue injury is suspected based on clinical findings.\n\n**ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:**  \nThe patient has an acute right ankle sprain. Management includes immobilization with an air cast, crutches for mobility, and prescription of meloxicam 15 mg once daily for pain and inflammation. She is advised to ice the ankle for 20 minutes, five times daily, and to bear weight as tolerated. The patient is expected to improve over the next few weeks; if symptoms persist or worsen, follow-up for possible physical therapy or further imaging will be considered.\n</response>\nThe reference note will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nCHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nRight ankle injury.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nJacqueline Price is a pleasant 28-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of a right ankle injury. The patient sustained the injury when she fell while in mountain biking lessons. She states that her ankle twisted outward. The patient localizes the pain to her lateral aspect of her right ankle. She denies any tingling, but notes numbness in her toes. She notes that she is able to move her ankle a little bit. The patient states that she has difficulty walking. Additionally, she notes that she has a limp when she ambulates. She has taken Tylenol for the pain, but states that it was not beneficial. She denies hearing a pop, but did hear a crack when the injury happened. Ms. Price notes that she has had a fever.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nThe patient has been mountain biking for 3 years.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nConstitutional: Reports fever.\nMusculoskeletal: Reports right ankle pain.\nNeurological: Reports numbness in the right ankle.\n\nVITALS\n\nTemperature in offce today was 98.6.\nBP: 118/77.\nHR: 77 bpm.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nCV: Mild edema.\nMSK: Examination of the right ankle there is edema and erythema on the lateral malleolus on the right side. There is associated ecchymosis and a few excoriations. Pain with palpation of the right lateral malleolus. Decreased flexion and extension of the right ankle, as well as internal and external rotation. There is no apparent injury to the right knee or foot.\n\nRESULTS\n\nX-ray of the right foot taken in office today reveals no acute fracture or bony abnormalities.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nAcute right ankle sprain.\n\nPLAN\n\nWe reviewed the patient's x-rays in detail today. The plan is to place the patient in an Aircast and provide the patient with crutches. I have also prescribed the patient meloxicam 15 mg to treat the pain. I have advised her to ice the area for 20 minutes 5 times per day. She can weight-bear as tolerated. I anticipate that she will improve in the next 2 weeks. If her pain does not improve with the Aircast, I will recommend formal physical therapy or pursuing further imaging.\n</gold_response>\nCarefully review the <response> based on the <conversation> and compare it to the <gold_response> when needed.\n\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Does the note provide correct clinical information based on the conversation?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the note include all important medical details from the conversation?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the note written clearly and organized in a standard clinical format for clinicians\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

in your right coronary artery how are you doing\n[patient] i'm thankful to be alive but definitely struggling and definitely scary time for me\n[doctor] yeah you know i'm i'm i'm glad that we went ahead and sent you to the emergency room now i know that you were in the hospital for about forty eight hours how are you feeling since you've been home you've been home a couple of weeks now how are you doing\n[patient] yeah they told me to really take it easy so i've just been you know doing very light work i i i do n't really do much outside of just you know sitting around and taking my medication but i would say i'm doing okay i feel like i have you know a little it i do n't feel perfect but i feel better than you know i did\n[doctor] okay and have you had any more of that chest pain since they put that stent in or is that completely gone\n[patient] i have not had any chest pain since no a little you know sore right after surgery but that doing much better now\n[doctor] okay and i know that they went through your wrist for the cardiac catheterization how is your wrist doing\n[patient] it's good i you know it was red for a while but it seems to be healing and i think there is no infection\n[doctor] okay and you're right handed correct\n[patient] correct yes right handed\n[doctor] okay alright and any shortness of breath when you walk around or move anything like that\n[patient] yeah i i would say you know i've been trying to keep my my i i'm not doing a lot of exercise but i will say that when i go up and downstairs you know i do feel like i have shortness of breath\n[doctor] okay now i know they put you on that medication the brilinta are you you're taking it correct\n[patient] yes i take it twice a day every twelve hours\n[doctor] okay great and you're still taking your aspirin correct\n[patient] i take the baby aspirin at night is that okay\n[doctor] yeah that's perfect as long as you take it once a day and you're able to afford the brilinta any issues with cost with that\n[patient] no i so far so good\n[doctor] okay alright so it's really gon na be really important for you to go ahead and continue to take these medications to prevent that stent from clogging again okay or prevent that stent from closing because we do n't want you to have another heart attack okay\n[patient] okay yeah\n[doctor] okay and how about watching your diet are you able to watch your salt intake i know that you really liked a good pizza every now and again are you\n[patient] yeah i i have eaten pizza a few times what i'm trying to do is really be diligent and eat well throughout the week and then i have had pizza a few times on the weekends is that okay\n[doctor] you can have a piece here and there you know the pumping function of your heart was pretty normal when i saw from the hospital your ejection fraction that's the pumping function of your heart was at about fifty percent which is you know low normal but not bad so that's good so okay just i would just watch your salt intake okay\n[patient] okay yeah i've been eating a lot of vegetables and and chicken without salt on it\n[doctor] okay great and then you know i i'm i'm glad that you're taking it easy now remind me this might cause you some anxiety were the denver denver nuggets swept or did they end up winning are they still in the nba playoffs i forget i know that you are a denver nuggets fan\n[patient] i am yeah they they are not sweep they were down three games but they wanted the last one so there is a there is a chance for it come back but they they play again tomorrow\n[doctor] okay yeah i'm a self expand and and we just swept the brooklyn net so i was really excited about that\n[patient] congrats that that's that's always good to sweep the nuts no one no one likes them\n[doctor] no one likes them okay well let's i wan na just go ahead and do a quick physical exam i'm just gon na be calling out some of my exam findings and i'll let you know what that means when i'm done okay so looking at your blood pressure here in the office your blood pressure looks good it's about one twenty seven over sixty which is pretty good on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any jugular venous distention there is no carotid bruits on your heart exam i do appreciate a slight three out of six systolic ejection murmur heard at the left base on your lung exam your lungs are nice and clear to auscultation bilaterally and on your musculoskeletal exam your right radial artery cardiac cath site is clean dry and intact there is no hematoma and there is a palpable radial pulse now what does that mean betty so all of that means is that you know you have a little bit of a heart murmur after having the heart attack but i looked on the echocardiogram and it showed that you know you do have mild mitral regurgitation which is just you know a little floppy valve which is is fine we'll just keep an eye on that and then everything else for the most part looks good so let's just talk a little bit about my assessment and plan okay so for your first problem of your inferior myocardial myocardial infarction i wan na go ahead and continue with your aspirin continue on your brilinta you're gon na stay on the brilinta for at least one year and aspirin you're gon na take lifelong until i tell you to okay i wan na go ahead and have you continue on the crestor forty milligrams once a day and i'm gon na go ahead and put in another echocardiogram for about six months okay do you have any questions about that\n[patient] yeah do you think i can no that sounds good i have one other more question though\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] do you think that i can swim again i miss swimming\n[doctor] yeah so at this point you're you know you're out like two weeks and your and your cath site is looks good so you can go ahead and and resume swimming now with that being said i would want you to just do a few laps here and there i do want to enroll you into cardiac rehab that's gon na give you a bit more confidence to go back to exercising and they also give a lot of dietary education and counseling in cardiac rehab does that sounds like something that you can do\n[patient] yeah i think i have to\n[doctor] okay i agree alright i also want you to go ahead and continue with your toprol fifty milligrams once a day and i'm gon na go ahead and order a some liver function studies and a lipid panel to follow up with the next time we meet and i want to see you again in probably six weeks okay\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] okay any questions\n[patient] no i think that's it thank you very much\n[doctor] okay take care bye\n</conversation>\nThe generated note will be provided in these tags:\n<response>\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:\nBetty is a 48-year-old woman

    "predicted_text": "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:\nThe patient reports falling off a tandem bike approximately two weeks ago, injuring the right knee. Since the fall, the knee has been persistently painful, especially along the medial joint line, with tenderness noted on examination. The patient initially managed the injury with ibuprofen, washing the wound and applying a bandage, but the pain has continued without significant improvement. The pain worsens with activities such as walking uphill and is associated with occasional feelings of instability or shifting. No prior knee issues were reported before this injury. The patient denies weakness or other functional deficits but notes discomfort with certain movements and some swelling.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM:\nInspection revealed a dry, dime-sized abrasion over the medial patella, with no other scars or skin abnormalities. The knee was tender on palpation along the medial joint line; other areas, including the lateral side, popliteal space, and posterior knee, were non-tender. Range of motion was full, with slight discomfort during extension and a sensation of clicking. Ligament testing showed intact medial and lateral collateral ligaments, negative Lachman and anterior drawer tests, and a positive posterior drawer indicating possible posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) laxity. The patella tracked normally, and there was no crepitus. The knee was stable overall, though the patient reported occasional shifting or instability during walking.\n\nRESULTS:\nX-ray imaging of the right knee appeared normal, with preserved joint space, no fractures, bone spurs, or malalignment. The radiographs showed healthy bone edges and good patellar tracking, with no evidence of bony injury or degenerative changes. Based on clinical assessment and imaging, there is suspicion of a PCL injury, possibly a sprain or partial tear, with no obvious meniscal or cartilage damage evident on initial evaluation.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\nThe patient likely sustained a PCL injury, possibly involving other internal structures. An MRI is recommended to evaluate the extent of ligamentous and soft tissue injury. In the meantime, conservative management with bracing, rest, ice, and NSAIDs (ibuprofen or a prescribed alternative) is advised to reduce swelling and improve function. The patient will be referred to physical therapy for strengthening and range of motion exercises, with an initial plan of 2-3 visits, adjusted based on progress.

or\n[doctor] no i did n't know that knee injury was a reason to but now that you've told me maybe we should talk about that\n[patient] we'll talk about that later too\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] alright so let's take a let's take a peek at your knee here\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] you gon na stick it through the screen or how you're gon na do this alright\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] alright then\n[doctor] i'm just i'm gon na i'm gon na grab your leg we're just gon na take it through just let it relax i'm just gon na take it through a little range of motion i'm gon na kinda poke around all different places you tell me where it hurts okay\n[patient] okay okay\n[doctor] alright now i'm poking i'm poking i'm poking so on the inside part here\n[patient] is this where it hurts\n[doctor] yeah like when you touch it it really hurts\n[patient] right there okay tell me what's worse here or here\n[doctor] on the inside\n[patient] okay so medial joint line tenderness\n[doctor] mm-hmm\n[patient] pes bursa nontender epicondyle nontender back of her knee nice and soft any pain back here\n[doctor] no i do n't think so\n[patient] okay popliteal space is nontender how about over on this side\n[doctor] no okay lateral side nontender skin she has got about a dime size little abrasions dry looks about a week week old right over the medial patella everything else looks good no scars okay how about can you straighten it out all the way i can but sometimes it like hurts a little bit like it almost like it clicks\n[patient] yep that's good though full full extension how far can you bend it\n[doctor] all the way back\n[patient] okay let's see\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] good good and how about the other side let me see the left knee can you bend that one all the way back too\n[doctor] yeah that's fine\n[patient] okay full full symmetric flexion no no deformities go ahead and just let it relax\n[doctor] mm-hmm valgus stress medial collateral ligament intact lateral collateral ligament intact okay so little kind of little laxity posterior drawer let me see the other let me see the other knee\n[patient] mm-hmm yeah so that that feels pretty much normal so she's got a about a one plus posterior drawer anterior drawer negative lachman negative good let's go ahead and just kinda bend and straighten for me\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] good patellar patella tracks fine no crepitus alright let's go back to this medial side you're tender right there is that right\n[doctor] yeah\n[patient] it's tender on the medial joint line but actually negative mcmurray negative lateral side negative mcmurray good so pretty stable you you feel like you you're kinda shifting back a little bit on this side compared to the other side does it feel unstable when you walk does it feel like it shifts\n[doctor] yeah sometimes\n[patient] what's what's the worst thing that that you can do that you do n't like about that knee is it walking standing sitting still getting up from a chair in and out of the car what what do n't you like\n[doctor] walking up a hill like any kind of incline really hurts\n[patient] yeah and you're it's just you're weak are is it\n[doctor] hmmm\n[patient] you actually no\n[doctor] yeah it hurts no\n[patient] what about you i mean are you real weak\n[doctor] no i would say i'm pretty strong\n[patient] did you go to the gym\n[doctor] i go to the gym but i swim so the\n[patient] okay i ca n't treat people like you you you you need to work harder i quit complaining okay\n[doctor] yes sir work harder okay\n[patient] do you do you play sports in in college or high school\n[doctor] i did in high school\n[patient] yeah so and you and you still doing anything athletic now other than just rocking kids\n[doctor] no\n[patient] just kinda you're thinking walking the dog\n[doctor] yeah rocking kids and walking dogs and going on the occasional swim\n[patient] on the occasional swim alright how have you been swimming since you hurt your knee\n[doctor] no no i have n't would you recommend that\n[patient] well i'm not sure yet it's because we might have to do surgery on your knee here and take that leg off\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] it's pretty bad\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] we'll get we'll get to that too\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] so did you already have x-rays of this knee today\n[doctor] yes\n[patient] okay do i go into that to\n[doctor] yeah\n[patient] look at the x-rays do you or just stop here you can okay okay and so what would what would happen now you would you could pause it\n[patient] you're only cup of this\n[doctor] let's take a look at your pictures here and alright so this looks pretty just looking at it looks pretty normal looks pretty healthy you can see how i all the edges of the bones here look pretty good i do n't see any bone spurs of that i do n't see anything broken everything looked looks pretty good kneecap's tracking good you can see the space here there's no real space there that's actually cartilage so that looks pretty healthy and you can see the other side looks both both look the same so x-rays look i do n't see anything obvious on that but looking at your knee here you may have hit that tibia bone and kinda pushed that bone back it feels to me like you may very well have sprained your or injured your posterior cruciate ligament that's what it's feeling like\n[patient] hmmm\n[doctor] i'm not gon na know that for sure or if there is other things going on in there but i think getting an mri scan to look at what you may have done inside there i'm pretty suspicious though that you may have injured that ligament if that's the only thing you did very rarely is this gon na need surgery okay so this may be something we wan na get you into a brace here get you into some therapy and get all your motion back and get your strength back and then maybe check it back in a in a few weeks and see because a lot of times those ligaments can tighten back up\n[patient] it's it's odd for just an isolated posterior ligament to need surgery\n[doctor] mm-hmm\n[patient] but if there's other things going on i ca n't tell you for sure that you did n't injure a meniscus too or maybe chipped some cartilage when that bone shifted so let's let's get an mri scan to look at that if that comes back with just a ligament like i'm suspecting hopefully this is something we can treat with some therapy and some bracing for a while and get this thing back to normal if after that couple months later or so you still have instability and still bothering you then it's possible we may have to do some surgery to fix that ligament\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] does that make sense\n[doctor] yeah yeah so in the meantime though do you want me to still keep taking the ibuprofen yeah i think that's fine for a short if it's helping the big thing right now is we want to get your strength back and your motion back get rid of the swelling that we still see here\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] so that will help with that ice ice packs a few times a day you can take the ibuprofen up to three times a day and i'll look i'll we'll look at the dose here there are some other medicines we can try that maybe do n't have to take so often that may be easier\n[patient] mm-hmm\n[doctor] so i can even send in a prescription for you for something that maybe just twice a day a little easier for you to take without skipping doses\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] okay you can just take it with breakfast and dinner\n[patient] mm-hmm\n[doctor] we'll try and see if it works better if your ibuprofen works better though go ahead and just go back to that but we can try this other prescription first\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] it's not very expensive and i can just call it into your pharmacy\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] and then we can we can get the brace fitted to you today we are not gon na look at a big big custom kind of expensive brace we will just put because it may just be temporary\n[patient] mm-hmm mm-hmm\n[doctor] and then i will get you a referral to physical therapy something that you can do close to home or close to work\n[patient] and then maybe i could see you back here in maybe four to six weeks and recheck this\n[doctor] okay how often am i gon na have to go to physical therapy\n[patient] i'm gon na kinda leave that up to you and the and the therapist i would start with a couple visits and then we'll just really see how you progress and what you can do at home if what if you have access to some equipment or things that we need to do but i want you to go you know at least a few times so somebody can kinda keep an eye on you make sure you're doing the exercises right\n[doctor] okay alright i think that sounds good\n[patient] did you get did you select you last night\n[doctor] i did\n[patient] you yeah what do you think what do you roof for\n[doctor] i so i i'm a little heart broken right now i was for the rockets and the way that these nets are crushing them it's just it's just painful\n[patient] are you serious\n[doctor] yeah\n[patient] rockets\n[doctor] i live in dallas yes\n[patient] yeah yeah that's not that's not my problem though you have not do you not watch the bulls\n[doctor] no no\n[patient] my gosh alright we're gon na have to work on you\n[doctor] okay thanks\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] bye\n[patient] you got four to six weeks to get your attitude straight we'll talk about this later okay\n[doctor] yes sir\n[patient] alright very good any questions at all\n[doctor] no\n[patient] okay so\n</conversation>\nThe generated note will be provided in these tags:\n<response>\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:\nThe patient reports falling off a tandem bike approximately two weeks ago, injuring the right knee. Since the fall, the knee has been persistently painful, especially along the medial joint line, with tenderness noted on examination. The patient initially managed the injury with ibuprofen, washing the wound and applying a bandage, but the pain has continued without significant improvement. The pain worsens with activities such as walking uphill and is associated with occasional feelings of instability or shifting. No prior knee issues were reported before this injury. The patient denies weakness or other functional deficits but notes discomfort with certain movements and some swelling.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM:\nInspection revealed a dry, dime-sized abrasion over the medial patella, with no other scars or skin abnormalities. The knee was tender on palpation along the medial joint line; other areas, including the lateral side, popliteal space, and posterior knee, were non-tender. Range of motion was full, with slight discomfort during extension and a sensation of clicking. Ligament testing showed intact medial and lateral collateral ligaments, negative Lachman and anterior drawer tests, and a positive posterior drawer indicating possible posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) laxity. The patella tracked normally, and there was no crepitus. The knee was stable overall, though the patient reported occasional shifting or instability during walking.\n\nRESULTS:\nX-ray imaging of the right knee appeared normal, with preserved joint space, no fractures, bone spurs, or malalignment. The radiographs showed healthy bone edges and good patellar tracking, with no evidence of bony injury or degenerative changes. Based on clinical assessment and imaging, there is suspicion of a PCL injury, possibly a sprain or partial tear, with no obvious meniscal or cartilage damage evident on initial evaluation.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\nThe patient likely sustained a PCL injury, possibly involving other internal structures. An MRI is recommended to evaluate the extent of ligamentous and soft tissue injury. In the meantime, conservative management with bracing, rest, ice, and NSAIDs (ibuprofen or a prescribed alternative) is advised to reduce swelling and improve function. The patient will be referred to physical therapy for strengthening and range of motion exercises, with an initial plan of 2-3 visits, adjusted based on progress. Follow-up is scheduled in 4-6 weeks to reassess symptoms and function. If instability persists or worsens after conservative treatment, surgical options may be considered. The patient is advised to avoid activities that exacerbate pain, such as walking uphill, and to monitor for any worsening symptoms.\n</response>\nThe reference note will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nBeverly Howard is a pleasant 33-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of right knee pain.\n\nThe patient reports that she fell off of a tandem bicycle and struck her right knee on a curb approximately 2 weeks ago. After the injury, she took ibuprofen and treated the wound, but the pain has persisted. She localizes her pain to the medial aspect of the knee. She also reports occasional clicking with full extension of the knee, as well as occasional instability with ambulation. The patient states that her pain is the worst when ambulating up an incline. She denies any previous right knee issues. She enjoys walking her dogs and swimming but has not done this since her injury.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nThe patient works in a Children's Hospital.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nMusculoskeletal: Reports right knee pain, clicking, and instability.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nSKIN: Warm, dry and intact\nMSK: \nExamination of the right knee: Tenderness along the medial joint line. Pes bursa is nontender. The epicondyle and posterior aspect of her knee are soft. Popliteal space is nontender. The lateral aspect of her knee is nontender. There is a dime-sized abrasion that is dry and appears to be 1 week old, over the medial patella. No scars. Full extension. Full symmetric flexion. No deformity. Valgus stress of the medial and lateral collateral ligament are intact. Laxity with posterior drawer testing. 1+ posterior drawer test. Negative Lachman test. Patella tracks fine. No crepitus. Negative McMurray test.\nExamination of the left knee: Full symmetric flexion. No deformity. Valgus stress of the medial collateral ligament is intact. Lateral collateral ligament is intact.\n\nRESULTS\n\n4 views of the right knee were taken. These reveal no evidence of any fractures or dislocations. Joint space is well preserved. No other abnormalities are noted.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nRight knee pain, possible posterior cruciate ligament sprain.\n\nPLAN\n\nAfter reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, we had a lengthy discussion in regard to her current symptoms. I explained that her x-rays did not reveal any signs of a fracture. I recommend we obtain an MRI of the right knee to evaluate for a possible posterior cruciate ligament injury. In the meantime, I have recommended that the patient be placed in a brace to provide increased support. I have also recommended that the patient attend formal physical therapy to work on her range of motion and strengthening. I advised her to ice her right knee a few times a day to reduce the swelling. She can continue taking her ibuprofen if she finds this helpful, but I am also going to send in a prescription medication she can take less frequently. The patient will follow up with me in 4 to 6 weeks to check on her progress.\n\nORDERS\n\nMRI, right knee\nPrescription medication\n</gold_response>\nCarefully review the <response> based on the <conversation> and compare it to the <gold_response> when needed.\n\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Does the note provide correct clinical information based on the conversation?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the note include all important medical details from the conversation?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the note written clearly and organized in a standard clinical format for clinicians\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

    "predicted_text": "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:\nZachary presents with a one-day history of achy, heavy pain radiating from his left elbow up to his neck and down the arm. The pain is intermittent, comes and goes, and was not associated with any specific trauma or heavy lifting. He reports chest pain that started yesterday, which is also intermittent, occurring a few times daily, sometimes associated with arm and neck discomfort. He denies shortness of breath but notes the chest pain sometimes accompanies his arm and neck pain. He has tried Motrin without significant relief. He reports recent activities include mowing the grass and household chores. He also mentions that his brother, a cardiologist, suggested the possibility of a non-cardiac cause for his symptoms.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\nHypertension (currently on Norvasc 2.5 mg), diabetes mellitus (last A1c 7.2, on metformin 500 mg), and no recent blood pressure readings prior to today.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM:\nVital signs: BP 150/90 mmHg (noting a previous average of 125/72 mmHg), heart rate regular, no shortness of breath observed. Cardiac exam reveals a slight murmur. No abnormal lung sounds. Musculoskeletal exam of the left arm is pending. No other significant findings noted.\n\nRESULTS:\nBlood pressure today is elevated; previous average was 125/72 mmHg. A heart murmur was auscultated. An EKG is ordered due to concern for possible cardiac ischemia given chest pain, arm, and neck discomfort. A glucose test will be performed to assess current blood sugar levels. No recent blood pressure monitoring data or recent blood glucose readings are available.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\n1. Chest pain with radiation to neck and arm, associated with a new murmur\u2014concern for possible cardiac ischemia or mild myocardial event. Immediate plan includes obtaining an EKG and administering aspirin and nitroglycerin as needed. Depending on EKG results, further action may include urgent transfer to emergency services.\n2. Left arm and neck pain likely related to musculoskeletal or referred pain; physical exam and further assessment to be completed.\n3. Hypertension: Continue current Norvasc 2.5 mg; advise blood pressure monitoring at home.\n4. Diabetes: Continue metformin 500 mg; perform blood glucose testing today to evaluate current control.\n5. Close follow-up: Monitor symptoms, review test results, and adjust treatment accordingly. Emergency services to be called if symptoms worsen or if EKG indicates ischemia.",

medical history of hypertension diabetes we're gon na check on those so can you tell me what happened to your elbow\n[patient] i just woke up one day it was hurting\n[doctor] it was hurting okay how long ago would you say that was\n[patient] since\n[doctor] since yesterday alright\n[patient] it's actually my it's actually my left elbow my left arm\n[doctor] okay they must have written that down wrong so it is your your left arm are you right handed or left handed\n[patient] right handed\n[doctor] okay so do you think you might have slept on it wrong or anything like that or what\n[patient] no\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] no\n[doctor] so what part of your elbow would you say hurts\n[patient] from my elbow all the way up to the to the neck\n[doctor] elbow up to the neck alright is it your entire elbow or or would you say a a individual part of it is painful\n[patient] just from the elbow up to the neck all the way up the arm\n[doctor] all the way up the arm alright\n[patient] or all the way down the arm to the elbow\n[doctor] okay and what would you describe the pain as is it like a stabbing pain is it numb what what's going on\n[patient] kind of a achiness achiness heaviness\n[doctor] achiness okay did you do anything yesterday that you think might have caused the pain\n[patient] just a just a usual day of working around the house\n[doctor] okay do you remember i know sometimes do chores you end up lifting heavy things do you remember doing that\n[patient] no no no nothing nothing really unusual you know mowed grass and that's about it\n[doctor] okay alright have you taken anything for the pain yet\n[patient] some motrin\n[doctor] okay and would you say that worked for you\n[patient] not really still kinda comes and goes and aches\n[doctor] okay alright so we'll we'll take a look at your your arm there because it's like your entire left arm up from your shoulder to your elbow does hurt in a second we'll do an exam of that so i see you're also coming in we're gon na check on your hypertension and you came in today your blood pressure is a little bit high it was one fifty over ninety i do n't think we talked last time about us getting you a blood pressure cuff so you could take those and keep track and and and and let us know so what have your blood pressures been running lately\n[patient] one twenty five over seventy two\n[doctor] okay that's not\n[patient] average\n[doctor] that's not too bad you might have a little white coat syndrome you seeing me today because it's a little bit high today so you're on that two . five of norvasc have you been taking that\n[patient] yes\n[doctor] okay that's good how about your diet how is that going i know you were having a little trouble before your sot intake was a little bit high\n[patient] i think i'm doing okay so\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] i'm doing okay\n[doctor] alright so as far as your diabetes your last time you came in let's say look at your a1c result it was a seven . two you were on the five hundred of metformin so what have your blood sugars been running\n[patient] i do n't really check them\n[doctor] you do n't check them okay so yeah we can get a a glucose test today and and and just check those because that's something we want to do everyday you know just to make sure you're eating the correct amount and that your sugars are are in range to make sure that and also to make sure that our medication is is the right amount as well so we'll do that that glucose test at the end of your visit and we could see if we can adjust your medication or not so let's go ahead and do a physical exam on you so i just want to double check make sure are you having any chest pain\n[patient] yeah yeah yeah on and off so it kinda comes with the elbow pain arm pain\n[doctor] okay comes with elbow pain arm pain\n[patient] chest pain\n[doctor] chest pain\n[patient] it kinda goes up my neck sometimes too\n[doctor] up your neck alright\n[patient] yeah it's that whole side it just aches comes and goes\n[doctor] comes and goes alright how often is that chest pain happening to you you said it's not constant\n[patient] it just started yesterday\n[doctor] okay so every hour every fifteen minutes would you say\n[patient] i do n't know mostly i had to stop mowing grass the other day it bothered me a little bit but but other than that it just kinda comes and goes i guess a few times a day\n[doctor] okay alright have you had any shortness of breath\n[patient] no\n[doctor] no okay just the chest pain alright\n[patient] yeah\n[doctor] so i'm gon na listen to your heart here and it it does seem like i do hear a slight murmur with your heart here and i i do n't think we've we've heard that before so i think i'm gon na get an ekg as well because i'm concerned you might be having like a mild heart attack so because you have the pain all the way up your elbow that go into your neck and your your chest pain as well i do n't think it's it's it's musculoskeletal pain because you said you had n't done anything with it so far so what i wan na do is and let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan here so i i do think that you or you do have that chest pain i'm concerned that you know you might be having a mild heart attack i'm gon na get ekg for that we're also gon na get you some aspirin is a nitroglycerin just to see if that helps with that pain as far as your for your diabetes i want you we're gon na get that p oct glucose and we'll keep you on be five hundred of metformin for now and then for your hypertension we'll keep you on that two . five

ILLNESS:\nZachary presents with a one-day history of achy, heavy pain radiating from his left elbow up to his neck and down the arm. The pain is intermittent, comes and goes, and was not associated with any specific trauma or heavy lifting. He reports chest pain that started yesterday, which is also intermittent, occurring a few times daily, sometimes associated with arm and neck discomfort. He denies shortness of breath but notes the chest pain sometimes accompanies his arm and neck pain. He has tried Motrin without significant relief. He reports recent activities include mowing the grass and household chores. He also mentions that his brother, a cardiologist, suggested the possibility of a non-cardiac cause for his symptoms.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\nHypertension (currently on Norvasc 2.5 mg), diabetes mellitus (last A1c 7.2, on metformin 500 mg), and no recent blood pressure readings prior to today.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM:\nVital signs: BP 150/90 mmHg (noting a previous average of 125/72 mmHg), heart rate regular, no shortness of breath observed. Cardiac exam reveals a slight murmur. No abnormal lung sounds. Musculoskeletal exam of the left arm is pending. No other significant findings noted.\n\nRESULTS:\nBlood pressure today is elevated; previous average was 125/72 mmHg. A heart murmur was auscultated. An EKG is ordered due to concern for possible cardiac ischemia given chest pain, arm, and neck discomfort. A glucose test will be performed to assess current blood sugar levels. No recent blood pressure monitoring data or recent blood glucose readings are available.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\n1. Chest pain with radiation to neck and arm, associated with a new murmur\u2014concern for possible cardiac ischemia or mild myocardial event. Immediate plan includes obtaining an EKG and administering aspirin and nitroglycerin as needed. Depending on EKG results, further action may include urgent transfer to emergency services.\n2. Left arm and neck pain likely related to musculoskeletal or referred pain; physical exam and further assessment to be completed.\n3. Hypertension: Continue current Norvasc 2.5 mg; advise blood pressure monitoring at home.\n4. Diabetes: Continue metformin 500 mg; perform blood glucose testing today to evaluate current control.\n5. Close follow-up: Monitor symptoms, review test results, and adjust treatment accordingly. Emergency services to be called if symptoms worsen or if EKG indicates ischemia.\n</response>\nThe reference note will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nCHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nLeft arm pain.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nZachary Wood is a 45-year-old right-hand-dominant male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of left arm pain. The onset of his pain began yesterday when he woke up with pain. He denies any specific injury. The patient locates his pain from his left elbow up all the way to his neck. He describes his pain as an achiness. The patient has been taking Motrin for pain, which does not provide him with relief. He also reports intermittent chest pain that radiates up his neck. He notes that he had to stop cutting the grass the other day because of chest pain. The patient denies any shortness of breath.\n\nFor his hypertension, the patient states that his blood pressure has been around 125/72 recently. He is still taking 2.5 mg of Norvasc.\n\nRegarding his type 2 diabetes, his last hemoglobin A1c was 7.2. He takes metformin 500 mg. The patient states that he does not check his blood glucose levels regularly.\n\nMEDICAL HISTORY\n\nPatient reports that he has a past medical history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes.\n\nMEDICATIONS\n\nPatient reports that he currently takes metformin 500 mg and Norvasc 2.5 mg.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nCardiovascular: Reports chest pain.\nRespiratory: Denies shortness of breath.\nMusculoskeletal: Reports left elbow, arm, and neck pain.\n\nVITALS\n\nThe patient's blood pressure today is 150/90.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nCV: Slight murmur detected, not heard before.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nLeft arm pain.\nType 2 diabetes.\nHypertension.\n\nPLAN\n\nRegarding his left arm pain, I have explained to him that his symptoms are likely a mild heart attack. I have recommended that we obtain an EKG for further evaluation. I have also recommended that the patient take aspirin and nitroglycerin for pain. The patient will follow up with me once the EKG results are available for review and further discussion.\n\nIn regards to his diabetes, the patient will continue the 500 mg of metformin for now.\n\nFor his hypertension, the patient will continue the 2.5 mg of Norvasc.\n</gold_response>\nCarefully review the <response> based on the <conversation> and compare it to the <gold_response> when needed.\n\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Does the note provide correct clinical information based on the conversation?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the note include all important medical details from the conversation?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the note written clearly and organized in a standard clinical format for clinicians\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

happening\n[patient] well it started about ten days ago with just some mild discomfort in on my right side and it seems to be getting worse over the last couple of days especially\n[doctor] okay and how bad would you say the pain is like it's a zero to ten on a scale today\n[patient] yeah it it waxes and wanes in severity it it's in general probably around a four or a five but sometimes it gets up as high as a seven or eight\n[doctor] okay is there anything that you notice that makes that pain worse or better like rest or movement or eating or anything else\n[patient] it's usually a little worse after a meal\n[doctor] hmmm okay\n[patient] in the morning before i've eaten it's it's not too bad but during the day after a meal it gets worse\n[doctor] okay alright and do you notice that pain radiates anywhere or moves you know any or anywhere\n[patient] it's pretty low it might radiate a little bit to the left but otherwise it's pretty localized to the right side\n[doctor] okay and have you had any nausea or vomiting along with the pain\n[patient] i've had some nausea and a little bit of heartburn but no vomiting\n[doctor] okay and and this is this is this is worse with you said worse worse with meals and is there anything else anything else that that makes it worse\n[patient] it is a little tender if i if i press on it and certain positions seem to make it a little worse when i'm most when it's the highest\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] pain\n[doctor] okay sure any pain with urination or any blood in your urine\n[patient] no no urinary symptoms\n[doctor] okay and how about

overeat you know during the super bowl last weekend did you that was i know probably lots of junk food floating around if your house is anything like mine\n[patient] well once the packers are out of the playoffs i do n't watch the super bowl so nothing i have n't eaten anything unusual\n[doctor] okay well that's good that's good and and no no travel i know you're a big big travel travel fan you know i remember you telling me about your trip to europe last summer that sounded amazing have you been traveling outside of the country again recently\n[patient] not recently just back to wisconsin but no unusual travel or other exposures\n[doctor] okay alright great and okay so so tell me about your migraines how have they been are you still taking the sumatriptan you know as needed when when you developed migraine you have have you had a migraine recently\n[patient] i have not usually they are responsive to just excedrin migraine i use the sumatriptan when i need to if it if it does n't respond to the over the counter analgesic\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] so\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] it's it's been it they've been pretty rare\n[doctor] okay okay great yeah you've learned a lot about it and and the treatments including the the term analgesic and all of that that's pretty impressive you've been you've been through the ringer i think with with those so okay and so you're taking excedrin when you get a migraine and then sort of would you say maybe for breakthrough migraines or worse migraines you'd take a sumatriptan occasionally\n[patient] yeah\n[doctor] okay got it and how about your blood pressure how has that been running at home are you checking your blood pressures daily still and how how your how how have your blood pressures been\n[patient] i have not been checking them daily i i probably check it about two or three times a week\n[doctor] hmmm\n[patient] and they're pretty good the upper number is usually around in the one twenties or low one thirties and the lower number usually in the seventies\n[doctor] okay okay not not too bad it does look like you're a little bit elevated today i i maybe i'm just making you nervous though so i hope not so are you but you're still on lisinopril twenty milligrams per day correct it looks like you might be running low do you need a refill of that\n[patient] yeah actually i was going to ask you about that if i could get a refill that would be great\n[doctor] sure we can do that and so okay but you are still taking that twenty milligrams per day correct\n[patient] correct\n[doctor] okay and alright fair enough so so let's go ahead and and examine you now karen so on your physical exam pretty normal and and unremarkable for the most part on your on your heart exam i do hear that grade three out of six systolic ejection murmur that you've still got that's unchanged from prior exam that just means i hear some heart sounds you know as i'm listening to your heart there i'm not too concerned about that we'll watch that otherwise normal cardiovascular exam and then your your abdominal exam gastrointestinal exam you have some tenderness in the right upper quadrant i would say mild to moderate tenderness and now if you take a deep breath does that and i press here does that hurt you\n[patient] yes\n[doctor] okay yeah you have i would call an equivocal murphy's sign in the right upper quadrant on your abdominal examination as well the rest of your abdomen is soft and no significant tenderness you have no tenderness in the right lower quadrant with deep palpation and you have no cva tenderness on your back exam as well and so we will talk about about that i am a little bit concerned about the tenderness that that i find on your abdominal exam the remainder of your exam karen is pretty normal and unremarkable and and so that's good let's let's talk about my assessment and your plan so first of all for your first problem of abdominal pain you you do seem to have acute abdominal pain with right upper quadrant tenderness that i'm concerned maybe a sign of some gallstones or possibly even an infection in your gallbladder so i'm gon na order some blood tests and an ultrasound today i'm gon na order a cbc chem twelve urinalysis a pregnancy test and also right upper quadrant ultrasound and so we will we will get those tests done right away i'm gon na keep you here we'll see how those look fortunately we've got the facilities for those and if we need to send you to the emergency department based on those results we will i do n't want you to eat anything right now okay in case we find something that might require surgery alright unlikely but it's possible and then okay you know karen i meant to ask you on your history one thing by chance have you had a fever along with this abdominal pain\n[patient] i've had some chills but no documented fevers\n[doctor] okay alright alright good yeah i i see you do n't have a fever today so that's that's good and so alright now for your second problem the migraine headaches you you do have a history of chronic migraines and and you have occasional bouts of of migraines nothing recent so let's continue the excedrin as needed over the counter for treatment there and then also the sumatriptan as needed for breakthrough migraine pain and i i would just encourage you to continue to avoid alcohol binges and caffeine binges and try to get enough sleep and all of that's easier said than done i know so but but that seems to be helping you now for your third problem of hypertension your blood pressure seems to be under adequate control so that's good we'll continue you on the lisinopril twenty milligrams per day and i will write you a refill prescription for that and send that to the pharmacy please continue to check your blood pressures daily so karen how does that all sound for a plan any other questions for me\n[patient] i actually do need a refill on my sumatriptan as well\n[doctor] okay alright sure yeah no problem so for your migraines the migraine problem i'm also gon na write you that that refill prescription for sumatriptan and anything else you can think of\n[patient] no the plan sounds good\n[doctor] alright sounds good we'll see you back in about four weeks or so and actually i am gon na follow up on your results today before i let you go but i'll check on those and and we'll we'll see how how you do and and hopefully be able to get you home today so we'll go from there i'll i'll see you shortly\n[patient] thank you\n</conversation>\nThe generated note will be

No peripheral edema observed.\n\nRESULTS:\nNo laboratory results are available at this time. COVID-19 testing will be performed to rule out infection. Blood pressure readings indicate hypertension, and recent blood sugar levels are within target range (~120 mg/dL). No abnormal findings on physical exam aside from sinus tenderness and mild pharyngeal erythema.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\nHannah likely has an upper respiratory infection, most probably viral, given the duration, symptoms, and exposure history. She is advised to continue supportive care with increased hydration, rest, and possibly trying a different cough remedy (e.g., Coricidin HBP) while monitoring her symptoms. COVID-19 testing will be performed to exclude infection. For her type 2 diabetes, continue metformin 500 mg daily; next hemoglobin A1c will be checked at her upcoming visit. Her hypertension appears to be worsening; plan to increase hydrochlorothiazide to 25 mg daily and continue regular blood pressure monitoring. No additional medications or interventions are currently indicated. Follow-up will be scheduled to reassess her symptoms and review test results.",

about your diet how's been thing as far as salty foods\n[patient] i've been trying to stay away from the salty foods but sugar intake i'm having a little bit of trouble with that\n[doctor] okay okay but it seems like you've been making good progress and that could be difficult sometimes and you mentioned being around i think you said your sister a few days ago or a family member\n[patient] yeah she was just kinda sick with similar symptoms and i noticed i started to developed a little bit of a cough right after\n[doctor] after that okay and how is your family doing how is everyone doing

was feeling okay\n[doctor] okay okay\n[patient] got back and started feeling poorly\n[doctor] sorry about that alright so what i'm gon na do now is i'm gon na go ahead and start your physical exam i looking at your vitals vitals look overall pretty good i do see your blood pressure is elevated at here it's one forty four over seventy two otherwise everything else looks good so let's check you out so first starting i'm just gon na check start with your sinuses and when i press here do you have any pain any tenderness when i do that\n[patient] no\n[doctor] no okay so no frontal sinus tenderness how about when i press on the on your cheeks here\n[patient] maybe a little bit just a little bit\n[doctor] on both sides\n[patient] yes\n[doctor] okay so bilateral maxillary sinus tenderness alright and i'm just gon na take a look at in your mouth if you can open up okay so i do see some do have some erythema of the pharynx and the tonsils are symmetrical i do n't appreciate any exudates now i'm just checking your neck and i do appreciate some anterior cervical adenopathy alright and i'm just gon na take a listen to you alright so listening to your heart so you have a nice regular rate and rhythm and you do still have that two out of six systolic ejection murmur at the left base now i'm taking listen to your lungs and on your lungs exam okay your lungs are nice and clear i do n't appreciate any wheezes rales or rhonchi alright and just looking at your lower extremities i do n't appreciate any edema there so let's talk about my assessment and plan so for your first problem of the cough so looking at your cough it does seem like you have a upper respiratory infection and so basically that's a virus most likely it's a virus that's causing your symptoms especially being around someone else who has similar symptoms and seems like most likely they spread it to you so i want you to continue with doing a lot of the time is just letting the virus run it's course and taking things just to help with your symptoms so drinking lots of fluids that's gon na help you trying i know you've been doing a cough medicine you can even try another one you have to be careful with the blood pressure and diabetes so you can try like a coricidin hbp can help with the cough and lots of rest okay lots of rest now we are in a current pandemic and so something i can check for you if you're okay with that is checking for covid if that's okay with you\n[patient] yes i'm okay with that\n[doctor] okay so we will check you for that today and see how you're doing with that and then we will give you those results okay any questions about that\n[patient] no questions\n[doctor] no okay so for problem number two the type two diabetes so we'll continue you on your metformin five hundred milligrams daily or twice a day you had blood work at your last visit so you'll be due at your next visit for your hemoglobin a1c and that's the check the sugars on your red blood cells so we do that about every three months so at your next visit we'll check that for you and then we will go from there but it seems like you're doing well with that now as far as problem number three your high blood pressure so your blood pressure is elevated here and it sounds like it's been you know creeping up just a little bit at home as well you're on a very tiny dose of the hydrochlorothiazide so what i would like to do is increase it to twenty five milligrams once a day again i would recommend that you take it in the morning just because you may have noticed it can make you urinate quite a bit and then i would love for you to just continue checking as you have been a few times a week just checking your blood pressure at different times of the day so we can continue to see how you do with that okay\n[patient] okay alright that sounds\n[doctor] alright any questions for me\n[patient] no questions\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] thank you\n[doctor] thank you alright so at this point now i'm just gon na press the\n[doctor] i'm gon na\n</conversation>\nThe generated note will be provided in these tags:\n<response>\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:\nHannah presents with a three-day history of a gradually worsening cough, producing green phlegm. She reports associated symptoms of sore throat and nasal congestion but denies fever, shortness of breath, body aches, nausea, or vomiting. She was exposed to her sick sister with similar symptoms. She has tried over-the-counter cough medication and increased fluid intake without relief. She notes a history of seasonal allergies with sneezing and runny nose during spring. She reports recent return from vacation and feeling well during that time.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM:\nVital signs show elevated blood pressure at 144/72 mmHg; other vitals are stable. Head and neck exam reveals bilateral maxillary sinus tenderness and some anterior cervical lymphadenopathy. Oropharynx shows erythema without exudates. Lung auscultation is clear with no wheezes, rales, or rhonchi. Heart exam reveals a regular rhythm with a systolic ejection murmur at the left base. No peripheral edema observed.\n\nRESULTS:\nNo laboratory results are available at this time. COVID-19 testing will be performed to rule out infection.

Denies any shortness of breath.\nGastrointestinal: Denies nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.\n\nVITALS\n\nBlood Pressure: Elevated at 144/72 mm Hg. The remainder of the vital signs look good.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nHead and Face\n- Examination: No frontal sinus tenderness. Bilateral maxillary sinus tenderness.\n\nEars, Nose, Mouth, and Throat\n- Examination of Mouth:\n- Examination of Throat: Erythema of the pharynx. Tonsils are symmetrical. No exudates.\n\nNeck\n- General Examination: Anterior cervical adenopathy.\n\nRespiratory\n- Auscultation of Lungs: Clear bilaterally.

Cough.\n- Medical Reasoning: The patient presents with symptoms similar to an upper respiratory infection. Most likely it is a virus that is causing her symptoms, especially as she reports being around some else with similar symptoms.\n- Patient Education and Counseling: I explained that we often let the virus run its course while we treat her symptoms. I advised her to be cautious with over-the-counter cough medicines as certain ones can affect her blood pressure and diabetes.\n- Medical Treatment: She increase her fluid intake. I recommended she try Coricidin HBP as a safer alternative to her cough medicine. The patient should rest frequently. I will order a COVID-19 test.\n\n2. Type 2 diabetes.\n- Medical Reasoning: Stable with medication.\n- Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged the patient to continue with dietary restrictions.\n- Medical Treatment: We will continue her on her metformin 500 mg twice a day. Repeat hemoglobin A1c will be due at her next visit.\n\n3. Hypertension.\n- Medical Reasoning: Her blood pressure is elevated today, and it sounds like it has been trending higher at home as well.\n- Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged the patient to continue limiting her intake of salty foods. >I recommend that she take her hydrochlorothiazide in the morning because it can result in more frequent urination.\n- Medical Treatment: We will increase her dose of hydrochlorothiazide to 25 mg once a day. She will continue checking her blood pressure a few times a week at different times of the day.\n\nPatient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.\n\n</gold_response>\nCarefully review the <response> based on the <conversation> and compare it to the <gold_response> when needed.\n\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Does the note provide correct clinical information based on the conversation?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the note include all important medical details from the conversation?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the note written clearly and organized in a standard clinical format for clinicians\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

wow well i'm sorry to hear that do you remember what you were doing when the pain started\n[patient] i you know i ca n't think about anything specifically but i am very active and i also have been renovating my basement so i have been doing a lot with that\n[doctor] wow okay and do you know if there was any direct or associated trauma that you can think of over the past three weeks like did you fall or hit your shoulder or anything\n[patient] no no trauma that i can think of at all\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] i do n't remember hitting it either\n[doctor] okay now have you ever had pain in that shoulder before\n[patient] you know i'm active and will have aches and pains here and there but nothing that some tylenol ca n't take care of\n[doctor] okay and and it's isolated to your left shoulder\n[patient] it is\n[doctor] okay are you able to move that left arm for me\n[patient] you know anytime i try reaching for something or lifting anything i have a lot of pain and i do n't even try to raise my arm over my head because that's it it really hurts\n[doctor] okay so now i wan na talk a little bit more about that pain are you having pain all of the time or does it wax and wane does it come and go\n[patient] it's all the time and if there is any pressure like when i try to sleep at night i ca n't even lay i'm a side sleeper and it i really gives me a hard time because i'm so uncomfortable so the pain is always there\n[doctor] okay so you ca n't lay on your left side at all\n[patient] i ca n't\n[doctor] alright now do you have that pain when you lay on your back as well or just on your left side\n[patient] i mean it's always there but when i sleep directly on it the pain goes up\n[doctor] okay now let's talk just briefly about your pain so if you have n't taken anything at all or have you been taking anything at all let's start with that have you been taking anything for the pain\n[patient] yeah i've been taking tylenol and i'll take two extra strengths tylenol every six to eight hours\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] and it does help take the edge off\n[doctor] okay that's good now without any tylenol what's your pain level\n[patient] without any tylenol i would say my pain is like a three\n[doctor] okay and then with tylenol with that\n[patient] i'm sorry i keep doing that without any tylenol my pain is like a seven and with tylenol it goes down to a two or three\n[doctor] okay that's good so the tylenol really does help you that that's a good thing\n[patient] yeah\n[doctor] so you talked about renovating your basement did you guys just move in or is it just time for a little house facelift\n[patient] yeah it just time we've been living in this house for some time now and you know with the pandemic we've been home and so decided to do some work\n[doctor] nice have you been into the new home depot that they just opened down the street here\n[patient] no\n[doctor] yeah it's nice my wife and i were there this weekend and they just opened two weeks ago so everything's fully stocked and if you guys are doing some renovations you might run down there and you know save big money at home depot\n[patient] i definitely will check that out\n[doctor] so are you experiencing any numbness or tingling in your arm or hand\n[patient] no\n[doctor] okay so if you do n't mind i'd like to go ahead and do a quick physical exam i've reviewed your vitals everything looks good there and i'm gon na do a focused exam of your left shoulder now you have limited active and passive range of motion there is some tenderness of the greater tuberosity of the humerus and there is no tenderness at the sternoclavicular or clavicular joints and you have good hand grip bilaterally neurovascular exam of your left arm your cap refill is brisk in less than three seconds and motor and sensation is intact to light touch now for review of your x-ray of that left shoulder the good news is i do n't see any fracture or bony abnormality so let me talk to you briefly about my assessment and plan okay so for your first problem of left shoulder pain your symptoms are most likely due to rotator cuff tendinopathy this means that the tendons of the muscles of that left shoulder have been injured and the injury happened to the tendons that make up or attach to the shoulder muscles i'm gon na go ahead and order an mri of your shoulder just to make sure nothing else is going on with that left shoulder i'm also going to go ahead and refer you for physical therapy for approximately six to eight weeks okay now during that time i want you to continue to take tylenol p.r.n . if your symptoms do n't improve we can then consider maybe like a steroid injection of that left shoulder which could hopefully get you some relief now do you have any questions comments or concerns about our treatment plan\n[patient] yeah so i'm really active so do you think that this pain will ever go away\n[doctor] i do i do believe that that pain is gon na go away many of my patients are successful with pt so we are gon na start with that take a conservative approach and see how you do\n[patient] okay alright\n[doctor] alright so i'm gon na have the nurse come in and get you some paperwork and i'll see you in about two about two weeks\n[patient] alright thank you\n[doctor] thank you\n</conversation>\nThe generated note will be provided in these

She denies any known injury or trauma; however, she is very active and is currently renovating her basement. She denies any associated numbness or tingling as well. While movements such as reaching and lifting exacerbate her pain, full flexion of the shoulder is the most severe. Her pain is also exacerbated if she lays on her shoulder, which subsequently causes sleep disturbance due to her being uncomfortable. She typically takes Tylenol Extra Strength, 2 tablets every 6 to 8 hours, for aches and pains associated with her active lifestyle, and doing so reduces her shoulder pain to 2-3/10 on the pain scale. Without medication, she rates her pain as 7/10.\n\nMEDICAL HISTORY\n\nThe patient denies any previous trauma or injury to left shoulder.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nThe patient reports that she has a very active lifestyle. She has also been renovating her basement recently.\n\nMEDICATIONS\n\nThe patient reports that she has been taking Tylenol Extra Strength, 2 tablets every 6 to 8 hours.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nMusculoskeletal: Reports left shoulder pain.\nNeurological: Denies left shoulder numbness or tingling.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nCV: Capillary refill is brisk at less than 3 seconds.\nNEURO: Motor and sensation in the left shoulder are intact to light touch.\nMSK: Examination of the left shoulder: Limited active and passive range of motion. Tenderness over the greater tuberosity of the humerus. No tenderness at the sternoclavicular or acromioclavicular joints. Good hand grip bilaterally.\n\nRESULTS\n\nX-ray imaging of the left shoulder was performed and reviewed in office today. These reveal no fracture or bony abnormality.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nLeft shoulder pain.\n\nPLAN\n\nAfter reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I believe this is most likely due to rotator cuff tendinopathy. We discussed the nature of this condition in detail, and I have ordered an MRI for further evaluation. I'm going to put in a referral for 6 to 8 weeks of physical therapy, during which time she should continue with Tylenol as-needed.

The onset of his pain began yesterday after he went up for a rebound while playing basketball and felt a pop in his knee. He states that he experienced swelling and difficulty with ambulation following this incident. He locates his pain today to the medial aspect of his knee. His pain is described as aching and is rated at 4 out of 10. In terms of his swelling, he states that this has improved some. He is also able to weight-bear, but he finds that he is favoring his left leg while doing so. His tried treatments include Tylenol with some relief as well as rest.\n\nThe patient has a history of hypertension and diabetes. He reports that he does not check is blood pressure at home very often, but he typically runs 140 to 150 range over 80. He is taking 5 mg of Norvasc daily. In terms of his diet, he states that he enjoys eating whatever he likes. His most recent A1C was 7.2. He is taking metformin 500 mg daily, however there are days where he skips this because of gastrointestinal upset. He denies checking his blood sugar at home consistently and that when he does check he has been around 150.\n\nMEDICAL HISTORY\n\nPatient reports history of hypertension and diabetes.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nPatient reports playing basketball, however this most recent event was the first time he played in 2 years.\n\nMEDICATIONS\n\nPatient reports he is taking Norvasc 5 mg daily, metformin 500 mg daily, and Tylenol.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nMusculoskeletal: Reports right knee pain and swelling.\n\nVITALS\n\nBlood pressure is 140/80 today.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nCV: Grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur.\nRESPIRATORY: Normal respiratory effort no respiratory distress\nMSK: Examination of the right knee: Pain with palpation over the medial aspect. Mild pain with flexion and extension. Edema, swelling, and ecchymosis noted. Mild redness. Negative varus and valgus stress test with firm endpoint.\n\nRESULTS\n\n4 views of the right knee were taken. These reveal no evidence of any fractures or dislocations. No other abnormalities are noted.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nRight knee MCL strain.\nDiabetes.\nHypertension.\n\nPLAN\n\nAfter reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. I have recommended that we obtain an MRI of the right knee to further evaluate for a possible MCL tear. In the meantime, he will continue with Tylenol for pain relief. I have also prescribed him meloxicam 15 mg for pain and swelling. He will be placed into a knee immobilizer and has been advised to remain non weight-bearing for the next couple of weeks.\n\nIn terms of his diabetes, he was advised to start logging his blood sugars daily and to avoid eating large amounts of strawberries. He will also be provided with a referral for a consult with a nutritionist.\n\nFor his hypertension, we are going to increase his Norvasc to 5 mg daily as his blood pressures have been elevated. We discussed our goal is for him to get closer to the 120/80 range.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nThe patient will follow up with me in 2 weeks to review his MRI results.\n\n</gold_response>\nCarefully review the <response> based on the <conversation> and compare it to the <gold_response> when needed.\n\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Does the note provide correct clinical information based on the conversation?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the note include all important medical details from the conversation?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the note written clearly and organized in a standard clinical format for clinicians\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

with elevated and fluctuating blood pressures so hi there mister thompson it's nice to see you again listen i understand you're having some trouble with your blood pressure control i would like to discuss that with you but first i want to ask you i'd like to use this app this new fancy app that's gon na help me focus on you a bit more in our conversation would that be okay with you\n[patient] yes that's fine\n[doctor] okay great it's gon na record our conversation okay perfect so jerry tell me mister thompson tell me about your blood pressure readings recently i understand you're concerned about them they have been up they have been down what's going on and any other symptoms\n[patient] normally my blood pressure has been very well controlled over about the last three to four weeks there have been periods where i felt a little lightheaded slight headache and when i checked my blood pressure the upper number has been occasionally over one eighty which is way past you know what any of the numbers have been in the past\n[doctor] okay okay and okay and yeah that does sound unusual for you and so it's been high but you've also felt lightheaded at times have you checked your blood pressure when you were feeling lightheaded was it was it low at those times or have you done that\n[patient] i've done it both when i felt fine and then when i had the lightheaded episodes actually it's been on the high side\n[doctor] okay alright understood and you have n't passed out or anything have you\n[patient] not recently\n[doctor] okay and have you had any chest pain or trouble breathing along with you know your elevated blood pressure\n[patient] sometimes a little heaviness in my chest but no no nothing sustained and i do n't have any respiratory or breathing difficulty\n[doctor] okay excellent and how about any headaches or other neurologic symptoms like numbness or weakness or you know balance instability or anything like that\n[patient] little unsteady when i get the dizziness and a slight headache when the blood pressure numbers have been a little higher\n[doctor] okay and when you say dizzy are you feeling lightheaded like you might pass out or you feeling that the world spinning around you or what\n[patient] just a little fuzzy where you just feel more lightheaded\n[doctor] okay alright understood and you've not had any any fever or nausea vomiting anything like that have you or diarrhea\n[patient] no\n[doctor] okay and are you feeling any palpitations or your heart racing anything unusual there\n[patient] not usually no\n[doctor] okay and are you still taking the lisinopril twenty milligrams once per day no actually i see we last visit we increased that to twice per day you're still taking that lisinopril twenty milligrams twice per day\n[patient] yes i am\n[doctor] okay you are not missing doses or anything are you by chance\n[patient] very rarely\n[doctor] okay great great you're still using that pill box that we suggested i think you had a pretty good system going there maybe maybe you're using that app now to take to keep track of one when to take your medicine are you doing that\n[patient] yes yeah i've i've used the pillbox and then tried the app it was a little confusing but i'm i'm pretty much on on track with staying on my medication schedule pretty accurately\n[doctor] that's great i think i think i remember you saying it was tricky to get that app set up but then your grandson helped you with it and those kids amazing what they can do these days right anything like that i always trust them my kids before me so hey by the way how did he do in his softball or in his in his little league tournament last month i think you said he had a big tournament coming up how did that go\n[patient] they they did great they they got all the way to the finals and then the team that the team that beat them was probably a little older a little bit more season but they had a great time\n[doctor] wow wow how fun that's fantastic well congrats good stuff alright well listen so so you're still taking your your lisinopril how about for your hyperlipidemia your your high cholesterol there are you still taking that atorvastatin\n[patient] yes\n[doctor] okay excellent and your osteoarthritis i know you've been you know a golfer in the past and you know you wan na get out on the course and things is that still under control are you able to get out and and and walk the full course and things still\n[patient] most of the time you know there are times when the weather changes that i have to maybe play less play less or or skip a day\n[doctor] yeah yeah but you're still okay well you're still able to get out and then you're kinda taking i think you're taking some tylenol for for you know mild mild pain and changing your activity as needed is that right\n[patient] correct\n[doctor] okay alright good good okay well listen let's go ahead and examine you here jerry so on your physical exam for the most part it's pretty normal and unremarkable on your heart exam you still have that grade three out of six systolic ejection murmur that's unchanged from your prior and just means yeah i'm hearing some heart sounds from the valves that's that's not surprising and i'm not concerned about it we're just watching that one otherwise on your your lung exam you have some mild bibasilar rales but no wheezes or rhonchi and excellent air movement and you have trace lower extremity edema on your extremity exam there bilaterally and otherwise really pretty normal exam so let's let's talk about my assessment and your plan alright so first of all for your first problem of your elevated blood pressure i do think your blood pressure is a little bit out of control meaning we need to make some adjustments i'm going to actually increase your your lisinopril to sixty milligrams twice per day and i'm also going to add twenty five milligrams per day of hydrochlorothiazide and that should help even things out i want you to check your blood pressure measurements twice a day for me for the next two weeks then let's see you back in two weeks and we'll we'll check on how you're doing and also for your second problem of hyperlipidemia i i wan na keep you on the atorvastatin i'm also going to send couple of blood tests i'm gon na send a cholesterol panel also a cbc with differential and a comprehensive metabolic panel and we'll check a urinalysis as well look and see how your kidneys are doing there as well and so we'll continue the current management with your atorvastatin there for your hyperlipidemia now for your third problem osteoarthritis i want you to continue to stay active as best you can do n't over do it but walking and you know getting out golfing when you can that's great you can take tylenol for the pain if you have some mild some mild pain there and yeah otherwise i think that cover it i think the adjustments in your blood pressure medicine should help and i

provided in these tags:\n<response>\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:\nMister Thompson is a 67-year-old male with a history of essential hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis. He presents with elevated and fluctuating blood pressures over the past few weeks, with occasional systolic readings over 180 mm Hg. He reports episodes of lightheadedness, slight headache, and a sensation of unsteadiness during these episodes. He denies passing out, chest pain, shortness of breath, fever, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, palpitations, or weakness. He notes that his blood pressure has been well controlled in recent weeks but has experienced recent spikes. He is concerned about blood pressure management and adherence to medication.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM:\nVital signs were not specified but are implied to be elevated. Cardiac exam reveals a grade III/VI systolic ejection murmur unchanged from prior. Lung exam shows mild bibasilar rales without wheezes or rhonchi. Extremity exam notes trace bilateral lower extremity edema. Overall, physical findings are unremarkable aside from the noted murmurs, rales, and edema.\n\nRESULTS:\nLaboratory tests to be ordered include a cholesterol panel, complete blood count with differential, comprehensive metabolic panel, and urinalysis to assess kidney function and lipid status. No recent labs are available at this visit.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\n1. Hypertension: Blood pressure is poorly controlled with recent fluctuations. Plan to increase lisinopril to 60 mg twice daily and add 25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide daily. Patient instructed to monitor blood pressure twice daily for two weeks and return for follow-up in two weeks. Emphasized importance of medication adherence and hydration, especially with warmer weather. Advised limiting alcohol intake to no more than two drinks per week.\n2. Hyperlipidemia: Continue atorvastatin. Ordered lipid panel, CBC with differential, comprehensive metabolic panel, and urinalysis to monitor lipid levels and renal function.\n3. Osteoarthritis: Continue activity as tolerated, including walking and golfing. Use acetaminophen (Tylenol) for mild pain as needed.\nFollow-up scheduled in two weeks to reassess blood pressure control. Patient advised to maintain adequate hydration and monitor for any new symptoms.\n</response>\nThe reference note will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nCHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nElevated and fluctuating blood pressures.\n\nMEDICAL HISTORY\n\nPatient reports history of essential hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nPatient reports he enjoys playing golf.\n\nMEDICATIONS\n\nPatient reports he is taking lisinopril 20 mg twice per day, atorvastatin, and occasional Tylenol.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nConstitutional: Denies fever.\nCardiovascular: Reports heaviness in chest. Denies heart palpitations or syncope.\nRespiratory: Denies dyspnea.\nGastrointestinal: Denies nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.\nNeurological: Reports headache and lightheadedness. Denies syncope.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nRespiratory\n- Auscultation of Lungs: Mild bibasilar rales, but no wheezes or rhonchi. Excellent air movement.\n\nCardiovascular\n- Auscultation of Heart: Grade 3 out of 6 systolic ejection murmur, unchanged from prior.\n\nMusculoskeletal\n- Examination: Trace lower extremity edema bilaterally.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN\n\n1. Elevated blood pressure.\n- Medical Reasoning: I do think his blood pressure is uncontrolled and we need to make some adjustments to his medication.\n- Patient Education and Counseling: The patient and I discussed that he should stay well hydrated during warm weather. I explained he loses more fluid when perspiring and will need to increase his fluid intake as needed. We discussed that drinking 6 to 8 standard glasses of water per day is an adequate amount. He may want to increase that amount if he is feeling particularly dehydrated or as he increases his activity level. I cautioned him from drinking more than 2 alcoholic beverages a week.\n- Medical Treatment: I am going to increase his lisinopril to 60 mg twice per day. Prescription for 25 mg per day of hydrochlorothiazide provided as well. He will check his blood pressure twice a day for the next 2 weeks.\n\n2. Hyperlipidemia.\n- Medical Reasoning: Stable.\n- Medical Treatment: I will order a cholesterol panel, CBC with differential, and comprehensive metabolic panel. We will also obtain an urinalysis to assess his kidney function as well. He will continue the current management with his atorvastatin.\n\n3. Osteoarthritis.\n- Medical Reasoning: Stable.\n- Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged the patient to continue to stay as active as he can without overdoing it. We discussed that walking and golfing are great activities for him to engage in.\n- Medical Treatment: He can take Tylenol for any mild pain.\n\nPatient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nThe patient will follow up with me in 2 weeks.\n</gold_response>\nCarefully review the <response> based on the <conversation> and compare it to the <gold_response> when needed.\n\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Does the note provide correct clinical information based on the conversation?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the note include all important medical details from the conversation?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the note written clearly and organized in a standard clinical format for clinicians\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

He reports recent onset of left-sided back pain, which varies in character\u2014sometimes sharp, sometimes dull, and migratory. He also notes increased water intake and nocturia, waking during the night to urinate more than usual. He denies fatigue, changes in appetite, or recent illnesses at school or home, aside from frequent sick contacts. He has a history of multiple strep infections and occasional episodes of pharyngitis. He is currently changing jobs, which affects his insurance coverage and scheduling.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM:\nVital signs were not specified. Physical examination revealed no erythema, swelling, or tonsillar enlargement in the oropharynx. No cervical lymphadenopathy was appreciated. Lung auscultation was clear with no wheezes, rales, or rhonchi. Cardiac exam was normal with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Abdominal exam was benign with no tenderness, rebound, or guarding. Palpation of the back did not elicit pain.\n\nRESULTS:\nNo immediate lab results are available; tests are ordered. The physical exam did not reveal signs of active pharyngeal infection or lymphadenopathy. The CT scan ordered by the primary care provider is pending, which shows findings raising concern for possible glomerulonephritis.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\nMichael's recurrent streptococcal pharyngitis raises concern for potential glomerulonephritis, warranting further evaluation. Physical exam shows no current signs of infection. The plan includes referral to ENT for assessment of tonsillectomy to reduce recurrent infections, and laboratory tests including lipid panel, urinalysis, CMP, CBC, vitamin D, and TSH to evaluate renal function, metabolic status, and overall health. He is advised to have blood work done promptly, ideally fasting, with most tests to be completed today if possible. A follow-up appointment is scheduled in one week to review results; if labs are normal, follow-up may be conducted via phone. No vaccinations or injections are planned today. The patient is counseled on the importance of managing salt intake, especially considering recent dietary changes and potential new job without insurance. The patient was provided with a note for work/class accommodations as needed.",

everyday strep everyday but anyway if he says i have strep then i have strep\n[doctor] i okay i respect that and i'm glad that you you listen to him at the end of the day that's always a good thing alright so now that we've gotten like kind of a lot of the history out of the way i do want to do my physical exam is that okay\n[patient] sure\n[doctor] alright so when i look in your throat like i'm not noticing any erythema no swelling your tonsils are midline so those look good when i'm feeling here on your neck i'm not appreciating any like lymphadenopathy no cervical adenopathy and like i wan na check those things because i just wan na make sure i'm not seeing any physical signs of like any kind of strep right now right i do n't want i wan na make sure you're not having an infection when i listen to your lungs i do n't appreciate any wheezes rales rhonchi that means i'm not hearing funky sounds your heart sounds great no murmur no rub no gallop when i press on your back remember you told me you had that left back pain when i press on it does it hurt\n[patient] no\n[doctor] okay alright great no tenderness on palpation when i press on your abdomen are you feeling any pain\n[patient] no\n[doctor] alright no rebound no guarding that's great okay so based on my physical exam we are gon na have a couple conversations one that ct that your your primary care doctor the the one that you you question his judgment it is showing a couple things that we are a little concerned about it could be that these recurrent strep episodes that you've been having it looks like they are like potentially that they are caused something called glomerular nephritis right there's just some some swelling here and we have to be careful of something like that because it could lead to like kidney disease chronic kidney disease and we wan na make sure that we cut that off right so the first thing is i'm gon na refer you for your problem of glomerulonephritis i'm gon na refer you to an ent i want them to look at you and maybe consider taking out your tonsils to see if that could help with some of the recurrent strep though that you're feeling but i would like to leave that to them to make that decision for you and me we're gon na do some more like confirmations right i'm gon na order some labs i want several a lipid panel a ua a cmp a cbc a vitamin d and a tsh all of these things will give me more information about kind of like what's happening in your body right now in terms of like your hormones and you know your iron levels and to make sure that you are like getting all the nutrition that you need and that your body is operating appropriately i know that that was a lot of words but let me know what questions do you have about your care and your treatment\n[patient] how much are all these tests going to cost\n[doctor] they are going to be free ninety nine because your mom is paying for them\n[patient] okay that's that's good to know\n[doctor] yes\n[patient] and when do i when do i have to do those tests\n[doctor] i would prefer you to get them done as soon as possible so when you walk out of this room there is a a blood lab right next door i need you to go ahead and do some of those draws some of them i will need you to not have eaten we are gon na do them it's called fasting and you can make sure that you have n't eaten when you do but they will the lab techs will know so you will be able to knock out most of those today\n[patient] okay and i'm not sure i will be able to do that today because i have a class right after this\n[doctor] mm-hmm\n[patient] and right after that i have to go to work\n[doctor] mm-hmm\n[patient] you know if i told you i'm about changing jobs did i\n[doctor] no you did n't mention that but one of the cool things about being a doctor is i can write you a note so you're gon na do it and then you can go to the class and we could figure it but like it's really cool that you're changing jobs i'm happy for you i hope you know that like it's always great to be able to make some income and make some decisions that means that you'll be able to start paying for your test soon uh\n[patient] well yeah this new job there is no insurance and my old boss sucks so i'm hoping i'll get a new boss and you know hopefully some free food with with this ut because it's had a restaurant so we'll we'll see how that goes\n[doctor] we might have to have a conversation about the free food at the restaurant if we do n't get some of these infections under control because your salt intake is about to be very important okay\n[patient] got it\n[doctor] alright okay so do you have any more questions before i send my nurse in\n[patient] do i need to get a shot today\n[doctor] no shots today just stopped\n[patient] okay and when do i have to come back for the results\n[doctor] i need you to come back in a week\n[patient] okay can we do that over the phone by the way\n[doctor] we could if if your results are normal but if we need to have additional conversations i'm gon na need you to come back\n[patient] excellent\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] thank you very much\n[doctor] no problem\n</conversation>\nThe generated note will be provided in these tags:\n<response>\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:\nMichael is a young patient presenting with a history of recurrent sore throats diagnosed as strep infections, occurring approximately four times over the past five months. He reports recent onset of left-sided back pain, which varies in character\u2014sometimes sharp, sometimes dull, and migratory. He also notes increased water intake and nocturia, waking during the night to urinate more than usual. He denies fatigue, changes in appetite, or recent illnesses at school or home, aside from frequent sick contacts. He has a history of multiple strep infections and occasional episodes of pharyngitis. He is currently changing jobs, which affects his insurance coverage and scheduling.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM:\nVital signs were not specified. Physical examination revealed no erythema, swelling, or tonsillar enlargement in the oropharynx. No cervical lymphadenopathy was appreciated. Lung auscultation was clear with no wheezes, rales, or rhonchi. Cardiac exam was normal with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Abdominal exam was benign with no tenderness, rebound, or guarding. Palpation of the back did not elicit pain.\n\nRESULTS:\nNo immediate lab results are available; tests are ordered. The physical exam did not reveal signs of active pharyngeal infection or lymphadenopathy. The CT scan ordered by the primary care provider is pending, which shows findings raising concern for possible glomerulonephritis.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\nMichael's recurrent streptococcal pharyngitis raises concern for potential glomerulonephritis, warranting further evaluation. Physical exam shows no current signs of infection. The plan includes referral to ENT for assessment of tonsillectomy to reduce recurrent infections, and laboratory tests including lipid panel, urinalysis, CMP, CBC, vitamin D, and TSH to evaluate renal function, metabolic status, and overall health. He is advised to have blood work done promptly, ideally fasting, with most tests to be completed today if possible. A follow-up appointment is scheduled in one week to review results; if labs are normal, follow-up may be conducted via phone. No vaccinations or injections are planned today. The patient is counseled on the importance of managing salt intake, especially considering recent dietary changes and potential new job without insurance. The patient was provided with a note for work/class accommodations as needed.\n</response>\nThe reference note will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nCHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nBack pain.\n\nMEDICAL HISTORY\n\nPatient reports that he has a frequent history of strep throat with 4 episodes within the last 5 months.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nPatient reports that he is a student.

He reports feeling warm but has not measured a fever, and denies chills. He experiences nasal congestion, sinus pressure, and throat drainage. He reports no shortness of breath. Recently, he fell down four or five stairs while coughing, injuring his right knee, which is now painful, with some ecchymosis and limited movement. He also notes mild cough relief with over-the-counter remedies. He has a history of hypertension and diabetes but admits to poor monitoring of blood pressure and blood sugars.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM:\nVital signs are stable: temperature 98.4\u00b0F, BP 125/62 mmHg, HR in the 80s, SpO\u2082 97% on room air. Facial exam reveals bilateral maxillary sinus tenderness; nasal exam shows erythema, edema, and yellow discharge. Throat exam shows a midline uvula with no erythema or exudate. Bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy is noted. Lung auscultation reveals coarse rhonchi bilaterally that clear with cough. Right knee exhibits tenderness to palpation, ecchymosis, decreased flexion and extension, and a slight limp, but no effusion. No other significant findings.\n\nRESULTS:\nVital signs are within normal limits. Facial exam indicates sinusitis; nasal findings suggest congestion. Lung exam shows bilateral rhonchi that clear with coughing, consistent with bronchitis. Right knee exam shows signs of ligament strain and possible soft tissue injury, with ecchymosis and limited mobility. No fever or signs of pneumonia at this time. No abnormal cardiac findings.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\n1. Upper respiratory infection with likely viral bronchitis: Supportive care with continued OTC remedies and guaifenesin 600 mg twice daily. Advise to monitor symptoms and seek follow-up if worsening; consider chest X-ray if symptoms persist or worsen.\n2. Right knee injury (suspected medial collateral ligament strain): Prescribe meloxicam 15 mg once daily for inflammation; order right knee X-ray to rule out fracture; refer to physical therapy for strengthening.\n3. Hypertension: Continue lisinopril 20 mg daily; order lipid panel to assess cardiovascular risk.\n4. Diabetes: Order hemoglobin A1c to evaluate glycemic control; encourage blood sugar monitoring and dietary management; advise patient to report blood sugars via patient portal.\nFollow-up: Results of labs and imaging to be reviewed; patient advised to return if symptoms worsen or new concerns arise.",

do you have any pain to palpation\n[patient] just right underneath my eyes\n[doctor] on one on what side\n[patient] actually both\n[doctor] okay okay on on facial examination the patient has pain to palpation of the bilateral maxillary sinuses on nasal exam there are there is erythema and edema of the nasal turbinates bilaterally with associated yellow discharge on throat exam can you open up your mouth on your throat exam the the uvula is midline there is no erythema or edema or exudate in the peritonsillar space on neck examination i do appreciate some bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy and on your lung exam there is coarse rhonchi present bilaterally that clears with cough on your heart exam your heart is in a nice regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur and on your right knee exam does it hurt when i press here\n[patient] yep\n[doctor] okay there is pain to palpation on the right knee and i'm just gon na move it all around does that hurt\n[patient] little bit

milligrams twice a day to help cough up some of that phlegm and i do n't think you need need any antibiotics at this time but certainly if your symptoms worsen i want you to call me and then we can go ahead and consider ordering a chest x-ray to make sure that you do n't have any pneumonia okay how does that sound\n[patient] that sounds good\n[doctor] okay so for your second problem of your right knee pain i do believe you have a a a right medial collateral ligament strain from the fall this morning and i really wan na just go ahead and and i'll prescribe some meloxicam fifteen milligrams once a day and we can refer you to physical therapy to help strengthen those muscles around that area and i'm gon na go ahead and just order a right knee x-ray just to make sure that you did n't injure any bones although i do n't think you did but we'll just go ahead and order that right knee x-ray how does that sound\n[patient] okay that sounds like good good plan\n[doctor] okay and then for your third problem of your hypertension let's just continue on the lisinopril twenty milligrams a day i wan na go ahead and order a lipid panel to make sure everything is okay from that standpoint and lastly your fourth problem your diabetes i wan na go ahead and order a hemoglobin a1c just to make sure we do n't have to make any adjustments to your metformin and i really want you to try to monitor your sugar intake and report your blood sugars to me through the patient portal how does that sound\n[patient] okay i'll try that i try my best\n[doctor] alright that sounds good i'll i'll be in touch with

running high can you tell me a little bit about what's happening\n[patient] yeah i've had blood high blood pressure for a long time my provider gave me chlorthalidone i do n't really take it because it gives me a stomachache but yeah i get headaches right here on the top of my head they kinda come and go they're throbbing tylenol helps the headache\n[doctor] okay alright and then so how long have you had this headache has this been recent or like acute or you've been having this for since you've had your blood pressures\n[patient] hmmm it's been on and off for about a month\n[doctor] a month okay alright and then are you having any other kind of symptoms with that like are you having any kind of you know dizziness lightheadedness any nausea vomiting\n[patient] yeah sometimes i feel dizzy and my vision gets a little blurry\n[doctor] okay alright how about like chest pain or shortness of breath are you experiencing any of that when you have these headaches in your blood pressure\n[patient] chest pain or shortness of breath\n[doctor] okay very good alright and then you said you were you've taken some tylenol for that and you said it did help a little bit or did n't sorry\n[patient] it does help\n[doctor] it does help good very good so how often are you taking your your medication are you taking that as prescribed like daily it sounds like you missed a few times but for the most part are you taking it\n[patient] yeah i forget a lot so i probably take it like every other day\n[doctor] okay every other day alright and then are you also now i know you also have some diabetes so are you how are you doing with that one are you pretty much taking your metformin everyday\n[patient] hmmm i probably take it when i take my other medicine like every other day\n[doctor] every other day okay so i do see that you know the nurse took your your vital signs this morning that your blood pressure is running quite a bit high it was like one seventy two over ninety eight so that's that's really a little higher than where we want it to be especially that you're on your medication but what we're gon na do is we're gon na take i'm gon na take a look at you real quick and then we can discuss you know maybe there's some changes that we can do in terms of your current regimen how about diet and your have you been sticking with that low sodium diet at all\n[patient] no i love mcdonald's i eat it all the time\n[doctor] i love mcdonald's too my favorite is big mac i do n't know about you but i got ta have my big mac with those large fries which you what's your favorite mcdonald's treat there\n[patient] i need to think of what fully of fish i love flare of fish\n[doctor] well at least you're eating the fish but but they can be very high in sodium especially the fast foods so we'll have to talk about maybe they can look at you know some some diet changes as well so the other thing is for your for your blood sugar here i see that you know you're running a bit high as well it looks like you're like you're about one seventy this morning and i i i i assume that you were fasting last night is that right okay so that's that's a little higher than what we want it's not bad it's below two hundred but it's getting kinda close to the borderline from where our limit is so we will take we take a look at that and also we'll figure out what we can do with that as well alright so at this point how about are you how is how is work how is life it's been good otherwise how's the family\n[patient] they are good i did eat a lot of my kids easter candy over the weekend so maybe that's why my sugar is high\n[doctor] okay alright great alright alright just just around easter okay not not too much during the the year hopefully\n[patient] yeah i try\n[doctor] well that's good so let's go ahead and do a physical exam on you real quick here okay and so i'm looking at your vital signs it looks like your blood pressure i we mentioned that today is pretty high your heart rate looks good it's with it's within normal limits here and then your oxygenation is fine so you did mention you did n't have any shortness of breath so that's good so let me just feel around your neck real quick here i do n't appreciate any jugular venous distention on your neck exam i no carotid bruits so that's good let me go ahead and listen to your lungs and your heart here real quick alright so on your auscultation of your lungs they're clear bilaterally on your heart exam though i i do sense a two out of six systolic ejection murmur now that was also there last year so it has n't changed any so we'll just keep monitoring that one and then let me take a look at your extremities here real quick theresa so let me look at your hands you got a little bit of slight edema bilaterally on your upper extremities but let me look at your legs here okay so you have a one plus pitting edema noted here on your legs bilaterally so that means you're retaining a lot of that salt that you're eating unfortunately okay so so let me go ahead and tell you about my assessment and plan here so definitely what you're experiencing is some uncontrolled hypertension now most of the time you know it's multifactorial right it's your diet it could be the medication regimen if you're not following that and then it might be that we are gon na need to change the medication around and also change your diet but i would like to start with going ahead and i want to continue your current medication regimen today i do wan na really encourage that you do take that everyday maybe set a reminder like on your you know do you use your iphone a lot for your reminders and things maybe we can go ahead and do that get a reminder make sure that you take that everyday but with that i would like to go ahead and also monitor your blood pressure let's do it three times a week it can be much when we do it everyday but maybe three times a week do you have a blood pressure monitor at home\n[patient] no\n[doctor] okay so i can recommend some really good ones nowadays that you can use at home and they're not that expensive and at least it'll give you some you know idea of what your blood pressure is running at and then i want you to come back like in a month because i wan na go ahead and see how your blood pressure is doing now that you know you're you you're taking your blood pressure medication everyday the other thing is i do wan na go ahead and have a nutritionist come and talk to you about you may maybe some dietary changes i'd like for you to start a \u2013 diet it's really to to help you know a lot of reduce a lot of that sodium intake when you're when you're when you're taking in your food so a nutritionist is gon na be able to help you figure out some foods that you know that you may like that you can actually use as an alternative besides the mcdonald's although you can have that once in a blue moon but you know not not too often okay\n[patient] okay sounds good\n[doctor] great and then for your diabetes i wan na go ahead and let's go ahead and increase your your metformin to fifteen hundred milligrams i think all for that too i want you to go ahead and continue taking your blood sugars to make sure as as you normally would to make sure that you know that change in medication is is actually being effective alright do you have any other questions for me at this time\n[patient] nope\n[doctor] okay great well i'm gon na have the nurse check you out and and i'll have the scheduler schedule you for a one month follow-up we'll take a look and see how you're doing from there see if we have then we will move from there okay\n[patient] sounds good thank you\n[doctor] thanks theresa\n</conversation>\nThe generated note will be provided in

    "predicted_text": "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:\nSteven presents with a two-year history of chronic low back pain, initially following a fall during basketball where he hit his back hard. He reports the pain as sharp, rated around 7/10, with intermittent throbbing. The pain radiates down his left leg, sometimes causing numbness in his toes. He experiences increased pain with prolonged standing and relief when lying on his side. He reports weakness in standing and episodes of incontinence (once over the past two years), which he attributes to prolonged standing and possible alcohol consumption. He has tried physical therapy (with minimal benefit), injections (unspecified), and pain medications (white pill, effectiveness uncertain). He has gained approximately 80 pounds over the past year and has a distant family history of scoliosis. He admits to past smoking but is currently a non-smoker. He reports low activity levels, mainly sitting at home watching TV.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM:\nVitals reviewed; physical exam shows no skin erythema or bruising over the back. Tenderness noted at the L4-L5 disc space with paravertebral tenderness on the right. Pain elicited with lumbar flexion and extension. Straight leg raise test is positive on the right. Neurological exam reveals decreased light touch sensation in the right lateral thigh (L4 dermatome). Patellar and Achilles reflexes are symmetrical. No overlying skin abnormalities.\n\nRESULTS:\nMRI findings indicate disc desiccation, a disc bulge with paracentral herniation at L4-L5, causing moderate right foraminal stenosis. Neurological exam findings and symptoms are consistent with radiculopathy due to herniated disc.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\nSteven has chronic lumbar back pain secondary to a herniated disc at L4-L5 with radiculopathy. Treatment options include a corticosteroid spinal injection to reduce inflammation and nerve compression. To address anxiety related to the injection, a pre-procedure anxiolytic will be prescribed. He prefers to avoid pain medications; thus, the plan is to proceed with the steroid injection under fluoroscopy. If pain persists after the injection, further management may include pain medications or surgical consultation. The patient will schedule the procedure at the front desk. No further questions; follow-up as needed.",

physical exam i did review your vitals and like part of why i wan na know about your smoking history is that you are stating kind of low like it looks like you are might be in the ninety five percentile range and so we might need to explore some things\n[patient] sent them off yeah\n[doctor] pardon\n[patient] because i'm fat my cousin was fat too and and he gained a bunch of weight he he had to have oxygen\n[doctor] you know honestly there are a few other factors weight gain does n't necessarily help you're right but like smoking has like a stronger impact so but it's okay we can explore like you know other options here i as i listen to your heart you have a regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur on so i'm gon na go ahead and do a back exam i do n't notice any overlying erythema or ecchymosis on your skin so no redness or bruising when i push here on your spine does that hurt okay okay so there is midline tenderness on the l4 l5 disk space with right sided lumbar paravertebral tenderness when you bend forward does it hurt\n[patient] yeah it hurts\n[doctor] okay and when you bend backward does it hurt\n[patient] a little bit\n[doctor] okay so pain with lumbar flexion and extension alright and as i raise your leg does this hurt when i raise your leg up\n[patient] stop\n[doctor] okay so supine straight leg test positive alright just a couple more things on neurological examination there is decreased sensation to light touch at the right lateral thigh at l4 dermatome patella and achilles reflexes are symmetrical so i just wanted to make sure that i documented all of that in your chart and in a you can ask me any questions but i did look over the results of the\n[patient] what does that mean like am i dying\n[doctor] no no no you're not dying but i think we have i think i have a good idea of what's causing your back pain so first let's talk about the mri that you had the results show a disk desiccation a disk bulge with parison paracentral disk herniation resulting in moderate right for neural foraminal stenosis okay\n[patient] that's a big word\n[doctor] those are huge words it's okay so let me tell you what like what all this means and what we're gon na do like for my assessment and plan so for your problem of chronic lumbar back pain based on your symptoms your exam and reviewing your mri that's consistent with a herniated disk at the l4 l5 with radiculopathy what this means is that one of your disks that sits between your spinal vertebrae is bulging out and this bulge is pinching on some nerves that's why you feel the tingling in your leg alright so that it's also why you felt pain when i pushed on that area so i'm gon na recommend some a spinal injection with a strong anti-inflammatory medication called a corticosteroid right i think you said that you had one before but i think this is something\n[patient] i had to have someone hold me down i do n't like needles so do you can i take a pill i do n't want that\n[doctor] we could yeah we could give you something to help calm down like the anxiety i would just write you a prescription for one and you would take that maybe three hours before you came in for your appointment and then you should feel calm enough to be able to do the injection\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] alright\n[patient] can i get pain pills too\n[doctor] can you\n[patient] for pain\n[doctor] can you get what now\n[patient] pain pills\n[doctor] so once i inject the cotocoid steroid in the in your spine it's gon na happen under fluoroscopy right and it's going to be it's a it's just a type of of like x-ray sorry to because i need to be very specific in where i do this injection so i say this because you should n't need anymore pain pills after we do this injection it should help with the inflammation and directly target the bulge to help you out so after this injection give it maybe a day and if you say that you're still experiencing pain then we can talk about maybe giving you pain medication but remember before you said it was n't as effective so i think this steroid shot is the best chance that we have\n[patient] i'd say it was n't effective\n[doctor] okay sorry i i i saw that they gave you strong pain meds but remember you said the white one did you say it was effective\n[patient] yeah i said i said the white ones i said they worked\n[doctor] okay i'm sorry so alright so maybe when let's okay so what we're still gon na do though we're gon na do the injection and then if it still hurts after that then we can explore that pain medication i do n't want you to have to consistently be on pain medication it's not necessarily like a good long term solution if after we monitor this you still are experiencing pain we are gon na try the pain meds however i would maybe recommend surgery\n[patient] i do n't want i know\n[doctor] right and so this is we're just gon na try everything that we can before you know before we get to that place\n[patient] mm-hmm\n[doctor] do you have any questions\n[patient] no\n[doctor] alright\n[patient] when it when is it when am i having this this when do you want me to get this injection\n[doctor] okay so you're gon na go to the front and schedule it this is a very quick and common procedure it should only take about an hour we will need to do this note like if this if this is successful we would only maybe do this four times a year so whenever at the front desk go ahead and schedule i think that mine pretty available to be able to help you with this alright any other questions\n[patient] no\n[doctor] okay thank you\n</conversation>\nThe generated note will be provided in these tags:\n<response>\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:\nSteven presents with a two-year history of chronic low back pain, initially following a fall during basketball where he hit his back hard. He reports the pain as sharp, rated around 7/10, with intermittent throbbing. The pain radiates down his left leg, sometimes causing numbness in his toes. He experiences increased pain with prolonged standing and relief when lying on his side. He reports weakness in standing and episodes of incontinence (once over the past two years), which he attributes to prolonged standing and possible alcohol consumption. He has tried physical therapy (with minimal benefit), injections (unspecified), and pain medications (white pill, effectiveness uncertain). He has gained approximately 80 pounds over the past year and has a distant family history of scoliosis. He admits to past smoking but is currently a non-smoker. He reports low activity levels, mainly sitting at home watching TV.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM:\nVitals reviewed; physical exam shows no skin erythema or bruising over the back. Tenderness noted at the L4-L5 disc space with paravertebral tenderness on the right. Pain elicited with lumbar flexion and extension. Straight leg raise test is positive on the right. Neurological exam reveals decreased light touch sensation in the right lateral thigh (L4 dermatome). Patellar and Achilles reflexes are symmetrical. No overlying skin abnormalities.\n\nRESULTS:\nMRI findings indicate disc desiccation, a disc bulge with paracentral herniation at L4-L5, causing moderate right foraminal stenosis. Neurological exam findings and symptoms are consistent with radiculopathy due to herniated disc.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\nSteven has chronic lumbar back pain secondary to a herniated disc at L4-L5 with radiculopathy. Treatment options include a corticosteroid spinal injection to reduce inflammation and nerve compression. To address anxiety related to the injection, a pre-procedure anxiolytic will be prescribed. He prefers to avoid pain medications; thus, the plan is to proceed with the steroid injection under fluoroscopy. If pain persists after the injection, further management may include pain medications or surgical consultation. The patient will schedule the procedure at the front desk. No further questions; follow-up as needed.\n</response>\nThe reference note will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nCHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nBack pain.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nSteven Reed is a pleasant 60-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for evaluation of back pain. The onset of his pain began 2 years ago after he fell and landed onto his back while playing basketball. His pain is rated at 7 out of 10 and is described a sharp with occasional throbbing. At times his pain will radiate down his left lower extremity. He also reports experiencing intermittent numbness in his toes. Prolonged standing exacerbates his pain and makes him feel weak. He is able to get some pain relief when laying on his side. In terms of his bowel and bladder habits, he reports 1 episode of incontinence over the last 2 years which he believes was due to prolonged standing and possible alcohol consumption. He other denies any other changes and denies loss of sensation in the genital or rectal area. He has tried an injection in the past, but notes that he does not like needles and had to be held down. Pain medication was tried but he is unable to recall the name of the medication. He also attended physical therapy with minimal relief. Currently he states that he is not very active and tends to watch tv all day. He has gained 80 lbs over the last year.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nPatient reports previously playing basketball, but he is now not very active and sits at home all day. He has a history of smoking, but denies smoking currently.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY\n\nPatient reports his 4th cousin has scoliosis.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nGenitourinary: Denies bowel or bladder changes.\nMusculoskeletal: Reports back pain.\n\nVITALS\n\nOxygen saturation is in 95 percentile range.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nCV: Regular rate and rhythm. No Murmur.\nNEURO: Decreased sensation to light touch at the right lateral thigh at the L4 dermatome. Patella and Achilles reflexes are symmetrical.\nMSK: Examination of the lumbar spine: No overlying erythema or ecchymosis. Midline tenderness along the L4-5 disc space with right-sided lumbar paravertebral tenderness. Pain with lumbar flexion and extension. Positive supine straight leg raise.\n\nRESULTS\n\nThe MRI of the lumbar spine was reviewed. This shows evidence of disc desiccation and a disc bulge with a paracentral disc herniation resulting in moderate right neural foraminal stenosis.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nChronic lumbar back pain.\n\nPLAN\n\nAfter reviewing the patient's examination and MRI findings today, I explained to the patient that he has a herniated disc at L4-5 with radiculopathy. We discussed the nature of the diagnosis as well as treatment options. I have recommended that we start with a spinal corticosteroid injection under fluoroscopy. The nature of the procedure was discussed. A prescription was given today to help with his anxiety during the injection as he states he does not tolerate needles. We also had a long discussion regarding pain medication. I advised him that we can do up to 4 injections per year and that we need to hold off on proceeding with pain medication until we assess his progress. I also explained to him that pain medication is not a long term solution and that if he remains symptomatic, it is possible surgery would be recommended.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nThe patient will return for follow-up after to assess his progress after his spinal injection.\n\n</gold_response>\nCarefully review the <response> based on the <conversation> and compare it to the <gold_response> when needed.\n\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Does the note provide correct clinical information based on the conversation?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the note include all important medical details from the conversation?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the note written clearly and organized in a standard clinical format for clinicians\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

move but i do have some pain lifting overhead raising my arm overhead\n[doctor] okay alright now do you have pain all the time or does it come and go\n[patient] it is some pain is all the time but it some is intermittent\n[doctor] okay now i you mentioned that you had taken some ibuprofen for that pain now let's talk a little bit about your pain rating okay zero being none ten being the worst pain you've ever felt in your life can you rate your pain for me without any tylenol or advil or any nsaid can you rate your pain for me\n[patient] about a six\n[doctor] okay now when you take that medication can you rate your pain for me what what's that pain level get to\n[patient] it goes down to about a four\n[doctor] okay so it does help take the edge off of that pain and and you're able to kinda move around a little bit then\n[patient] yes\n[doctor] okay so the remodel tell me a little bit about that my wife and i were working on our remodel and we went they just built the brand-new lowe's here in town have you guys been there yet\n[patient] no we have not\n[doctor] well i did n't know if you know this or not but you can save big money there that's the rumor\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] so yeah we we've been down there we got some pain we we got went and got some samples and then hey while we were there we ended up deciding to put down a bunch of flooring too so i really recommend you guys if you get a chance go over there and take a look at their sales and and see if you ca n't finish your remodeled project\n[patient] that sounds great i'll have to take a look at the flooring as well\n[doctor] that sounds good so now just out of curiosity are you experiencing any numbness or tingling in in your arm or hand\n[patient] i did when i initially hurt it but i'm not no longer having any numbness or tingling\n[doctor] okay so a little bit about my physical exam i'm gon na do a quick physical exam on you today now your vitals look good but specifically on your right shoulder exam you do have limited active and passive range of motion and there is tenderness to the greater tuberosity of the humerus now there is no tenderness at your sternoclavicular joint and you do have good strong bilateral hand grips and on your neurovascular exam of your right arm you do have brisk capillary refill of less than three seconds and you do have equal and bilateral response to sensation and touch which is good now taking a look at your x-ray that we did when you came in today good news is that right shoulder x-ray reveals no fracture or bony abnormality mkay so let me tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan now i your symptoms are most likely due to rotator cuff tendinopathy i think that you've injured the tendons of the muscles that make up the shoulder so that i think that's that's why you are having the that shoulder pain i do wan na order an mri of that right shoulder just to make sure that nothing else is going on now i'm gon na refer you to physical therapy and that's gon na be about six to eight weeks now my patients are very successful with their pt and let's see how you do before we make the decision that we would do additional treatment such as a steroid injection to that shoulder i do want you to continue to take an nsaid if you can tolerate tylenol i want you to go ahead and take tylenol for that pain do you have any questions comments or concerns about our treatment plan\n[patient] no i think it sounds good ca n't wait to to get some relief\n[doctor] okay so i know we ordered it for six to eight weeks but i wan na see you again in two weeks and we'll evaluate how you're doing and make some additional treatment plan at that at that time okay\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] alright sounds good we will get the nurse

He reports difficulty adjusting to dark environments and perceives straight lines, such as door frames and paneling, as wavy or crooked. He notes worsening over the past three to four months. He also mentions difficulty reading in dim lighting. Additionally, he reports recent social outings, including dining at a new Italian restaurant, with no specific ocular symptoms related to these events. He admits to ongoing smoking habits, approximately one pack per day, despite previous attempts to quit, and has a history of high blood pressure but admits to not taking his medication regularly.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM:\nOphthalmologic examination revealed posterior chamber intraocular lenses in both eyes. The right eye's cornea is clear; no neovascularization or abnormal cupping noted. Fundus examination shows the retina attached 360 degrees with no tears or holes; presence of drusen in the macula, RPE changes in the fovea, retinal thickening, subretinal fluid, exudates, and a hemorrhage. The left eye's cornea is clear; no hemorrhage or subretinal fluid; retina attached with similar RPE changes in the fovea. An anterior segment exam was performed with the patient\u2019s eyes examined under bright light, and intraocular lenses were confirmed.\n\nRESULTS:\nDiagnostic testing, including fundus examination and fluorescein angiography, demonstrated drusen deposits under the RPE, subretinal fluid, and leakage consistent with neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The fluorescein angiography revealed focal leakage in the right eye indicative of choroidal neovascularization.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\nThe patient is diagnosed with neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration, an advanced stage of AMD characterized by abnormal blood vessel growth beneath the retina leading to fluid, blood leakage, and potential severe central vision loss. The treatment plan includes intravitreal injections of Lucentis (ranibizumab) once monthly to slow disease progression and preserve vision. The patient was counseled about the procedure, including the use of local anesthesia and the minimal discomfort involved. He was advised on the importance of smoking cessation and medication adherence for hypertension management. The patient expressed understanding and consented to proceed with the scheduled injections. Follow-up will be arranged to monitor treatment response and disease progression.",

vision changes and looks like you're having trouble with your right eye can you tell me a little bit about what brought you in to see me today\n[patient] yeah you know i started noticing my wife and i we we eat out almost every night and it's when especially when we go to fancy place\n[doctor] mm-hmm\n[patient] i have trouble adjusting in the that dark dim environment\n[doctor] okay and i reviewed my technician's notes before i came in to see you and it says you know you you've been having that decreased vision when you're reading especially in dark place like you just said but it also mentions here that it looks like you told her that when you look at straight lines like in your door frame it looks like things have been looking a little crooked to you how long has that been going on\n[patient] well you know it's been going on a little while probably getting worse over the last three to four months and you know my my office has paneling and you know how that paneling has that dark grooves in it those straight lines well they always look wavy to me\n[doctor] okay alright so it's been going on a few months now you mentioned that you and your wife go out to eat every night have you tried the new the new italium place over there on main street\n[patient] my gosh yes we were just there the other night down in the it's down in the basement of that big building yeah we went there the other night and i got ta tell you it was like the saprano family was sitting across from us there was this bunch of old guys that had bottles of of red wine all over the table and they were my gosh it was so good and the food i mean i mean i ca n't tell you how great the food was\n[doctor] it was\n[patient] it was just phenomenal\n[doctor] it was amazing my wife and i went over there the other day and when we walked downstairs it was like i was walking into a scene out of saprano's\n[patient] mm-hmm\n[doctor] but the food was amazing it was the best egg plant parmer's john i've i've ever had where really super excited about going back there here very very soon\n[patient] yeah i had the bio marsal and it was my gosh it was to die for\n[doctor] i'll have to get that next time i go so in reviewing your paperwork here it looks like you made mention that you smoke are you still smoking about a pack a day\n[patient] yeah i i tried i've tried i've done hypnosis i've done lozenges i've done chewing gum and i get real close but you know i'll just go out one evening without the wife and and the next thing i know i'm i'm you know buying a cigarette off of somebody and it's it's really hard for me to get that stopped\n[doctor] yeah i i appreciate that but it's really gon na be important that you try to to either cut back or quit smoking altogether now that leads me into my next concern here it looks like you have a history of high blood pressure and i'm just wondering are you are you taking your blood pressure medication as prescribed and and are you checking your blood pressures on a regular basis\n[patient] i'm glad you just mentioned that because i have n't taken my blood pressure pill for a while it's up in the cupboard and it's back in that corner and i just i ca n't forget to take it\n[doctor] okay it's really gon na be important that you take your medication for your blood pressure as prescribed i'd really like to see you start doing that today and then let's let's go ahead and and let's set that that pill bottle down on the counter and see if that does n't help you remember to take that blood pressure medicine if it's okay with you i would like to do a a quick physical exam on your eyes i'm gon na go ahead and take off your glasses and put your chin here in the chin rest for me\n[patient] okay that's a bright light\n[doctor] yeah i'm sorry about that it it's just gon na help me check the lenses in both of your eyes so it looks like the anterior segment examination reveals posterior chamber intraocular lenses in both eyes for the right eye the cornea is clear no nvi peak hole cup to disc is . two fundus examination of the right eye shows the retina to be attached three hundred and sixty degrees no holes or tears noted and rpe changes in the fovea now the posterior segment exam shows drusen in the macula retinal thickening and presence of subretinal fluid and exudate accumulation and it is positive for a hemorrhage now for your left eye the cornea is clear no mvi pecal cup to disc is . three rpe changes in the fovea no hemorrhage noted or subretinal fluid noted and the retina is attached appropriately now i reviewed the results of your diagnostic exam so the otc exam shows those drusen deposits under the rpe which is the retinal pigment epithelium and then the subretinal fluid so the srf accumulation and choroidal neovascular membrane can also be visualized in that test now the fluorescein angiography so the using the the fluorescein there reveals that the focal area of the leakage in the right eye is consistent with neurovascular age related macular degeneration now for my impression and plan it looks like the diagnostic test and the eye exams are consistent with the neovascular age related macular degeneration also called wet macular degeneration now it's advanced to a stage that usually leads to more severe vision loss happening now this happens when those abnormal blood vessels start to grow beneath the retina what happens is they leak fluid and blood which is wides called wet macular degeneration and what happens is secondary to that it creates a large blind spot in the center of your visual field that's why it it kinda looks like you'll see a black dot in the center of your vision field now it is the most common cause of severe vision loss now the good news is we have a plan for you for this now once a month i want to give you an injection of lucent now it's gon na be injected in the vitreous portion of the eye after we numb the eye so you're not gon na feel any pain and those injections yeah i know the one once i numb the eye you wo n't feel any pain in that injection at all patients report no pain at all for the actual injection\n[patient] have you ever somebody stick a needle in your eye\n[doctor] well\n[patient] what i mean not not yeah literally stick a needle in your eye\n[doctor] yeah literally yeah\n[patient] yeah\n[doctor] the good news is injection given over time can slow the rate of the vision decline and maybe even stop it however i also have to let you know that there could be a situation where you may still note a small amount of vision loss but this is your best chance of maintaining that vision for as long as you can so i know i have given you a lot of information i wan na pause here and see if you have any questions comments or concerns before we get you scheduled for that injection\n[patient] no i'm i mean as as long as you think it wo n't hurt a lot that will be good\n[doctor] okay i think it's gon na be our best plan to help slow this disease process\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] alright so i'm gon na have the nurse come in and get you prepped and we're gon na go ahead and do the first injection today\n[patient] okay okay\n[doctor] sounds good i'll be back in a couple of minutes\n[patient] okay thank you very much\n[doctor] thank you\n</conversation>\nThe generated note will be provided in these tags:\n<response>\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:\nMatthew presents with a several-month history of progressive visual changes, primarily affecting his right eye. He reports difficulty adjusting to dark environments and perceives straight lines, such as door frames and paneling, as wavy or crooked. He notes worsening over the past three to four months. He also mentions difficulty reading in dim lighting. Additionally, he reports recent social outings, including dining at a new Italian restaurant, with no specific ocular symptoms related to these events. He admits to ongoing smoking habits, approximately one pack per day, despite previous attempts to quit, and has a history of high blood pressure but admits to not taking his medication regularly.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM:\nOphthalmologic examination revealed posterior chamber intraocular lenses in both eyes. The right eye's cornea is clear; no neovascularization or abnormal cupping noted. Fundus examination shows the retina attached 360 degrees with no tears or holes; presence of drusen in the macula, RPE changes in the fovea, retinal thickening, subretinal fluid, exudates, and a hemorrhage. The left eye's cornea is clear; no hemorrhage or subretinal fluid; retina attached with similar RPE changes in the fovea. An anterior segment exam was performed with the patient\u2019s eyes examined under bright light, and intraocular lenses were confirmed.\n\nRESULTS:\nDiagnostic testing, including fundus examination and fluorescein angiography, demonstrated drusen deposits under the RPE, subretinal fluid, and leakage consistent with neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The fluorescein angiography revealed focal leakage in the right eye indicative of choroidal neovascularization.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\nThe patient is diagnosed with neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration, an advanced stage of AMD characterized by abnormal blood vessel growth beneath the retina leading to fluid, blood leakage, and potential severe central vision loss. The treatment plan includes intravitreal injections of Lucentis (ranibizumab) once monthly to slow disease progression and preserve vision. The patient was counseled about the procedure, including the use of local anesthesia and the minimal discomfort involved. He was advised on the importance of smoking cessation and medication adherence for hypertension management. The patient expressed understanding and consented to proceed with the scheduled injections. Follow-up will be arranged to monitor treatment response and disease progression.\n</response>\nThe reference note will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nCHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nVision changes in the right eye.\n\nMEDICAL HISTORY\n\nPatient reports history of high blood pressure.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nPatient reports he is smoking 1 pack of cigarettes daily.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nEyes: Reports right eye vision changes.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nEyes\n- Examination of the right eye: Posterior chamber intraocular lenses present bilaterally. Right eye cornea is clear without NVI and cup-disc ratio is 0.2. Fundus of right eye shows retina is intact 360 degrees without holes or tears noted, and RPE changes in fovea. Posterior segment shows drusen of the macula, retinal thickening, and presence of subretinal fluid and exudate accumulation. Positive hemorrhage\nExamination of the left eye: Cornea is clear. No NVI. Cup-disc ration is 0.3. RPE changes in fovea. No hemorrhage noted or subretinal fluid noted. Retina is attached appropriately.\n\nRESULTS\n\nOTC:\nDrusen deposits under the RPE. SRF accumulation and choroidal neovascular membrane can also be visualized.\n\nFluorescein angiography:\nReveals that the focal area of the leakage in the right eye is consistent with neovascular age related macular degeneration.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN\n\n1. Wet macular degeneration.\n- Medical Reasoning: The diagnostic test and eye exams are consistent with neovascular age-related macular degeneration, also called wet macular degeneration.\n- Patient Education and Counseling: I explained the nature of the diagnosis and that this is advanced to a stage that usually leads to more severe vision loss happening. We discussed this happens when those abnormal blood vessels start to grow beneath the retina leaking fluid and blood. Secondary to that, it creates a large blind spot in the center of his visual field. He was advised that this is the most common cause of severe vision loss. I explained the treatment plan at length. He understands he is going to be injected in the vitreous portion of the eye after we numb the eye, so he is not going to feel any pain. I advised injections given over time can slow the rate of the vision decline and maybe even stop it. However, I also have to let him know that there could be a situation where he may still note a small amount of vision loss, but this is his best chance of maintaining that vision for as long as he can. Additionally, patient was counseled on the importance of taking his blood pressure medication. Questions were invited and answered today.\n- Medical Treatment: Lucentis injections once a month with his first being performed today.\n\nPatient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.\n</gold_response>\nCarefully review the <response> based on the <conversation> and compare it to the <gold_response> when needed.\n\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Does the note provide correct clinical information based on the conversation?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the note include all important medical details from the conversation?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the note written clearly and organized in a standard clinical format for clinicians\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

three nonsmol cell lung cancer and so we are following up on your neo adevant chemotherapy so you can you tell me how you're doing today\n[patient] yeah you know i'm i'm doing okay i have a little bit of some shortness of breath that i noticed over the weekend and you know i i'm i considered myself pretty active before this i would walk my dog around the block and now i i ca n't even walk you know down the street without being short of breath\n[doctor] okay yeah yeah i mean that's that's definitely understandable it says you had a four point four centimeter left upper lobe nodule in there so it's kinda big but that's understandable and we're doing the chemo to try to reduce that that that tumor that you do have so how often do you normally run with your dogs\n[patient] i mean i would i would take them for i would normally take them for like mile long walks everyday and just this weekend i could only walk down to the end of the street i had to have my husband take the dog fit walk\n[doctor] man okay what kind of dog do you have\n[patient] i have a dobrman\n[doctor] yeah they are pretty active that makes sense alright so have you been coughing have you had any phlegm\n[patient] i've been having a dry cough no phlegm\n[doctor] okay have you noticed any fever\n[patient] no fever\n[doctor] no fever alright what about any other symptoms like any body aches any sore throat sinus pain\n[patient] well i mean now that you mentioned it like every time i swallow it hurts it does n't feel like i have a cold because it hurts down here more in my chest but every time i swallow it it's really painful\n[doctor] okay so when you are swallowing i know some of my patients feel this do you feel like the food is getting stuck\n[patient] no the food is not getting stuck it just hurts\n[doctor] okay what about when you're you're taking liquids are you able to take in both hydrocort liquids\n[patient] i mean i definitely feel like over the weekend i have n't been taking it as much because it hurt so much but i i am able to i am able to drink and i've been taking ensure and things like that i had a milk shake\n[doctor] okay that's that's that's that's good yeah we we definitely want you to to take in as much liquid as possible best especially since you're on the chemotherapy and the radiation just so you wo n't get dehydrated because that will make you feel a lot worse if you are dehydrated okay so on a on a mental emotional standpoint i know you said you have your husband with you how you doing with that you have the support that you need you need to speak to me though\n[patient] it's very helpful you know as you can understand i'm just like devastated when i got this diagnosis and i'm just i'm just trying to figure everything out and but he is very good and my daughter is is very helpful too and i you know i think for the most part i'm very fortunate to have them\n[doctor] okay so how how are you feeling on your chemo see you're on a combination of sysplatin and a topicide you had your last dose a few days ago any nausea any fatigue from that\n[patient] i was a little nauseated and tired but i took the zofran that you prescribed and that seemed to help and you know i i got some rest it's it's it's been okay\n[doctor] okay that's good so let me do a quick physical exam on you just gon na check your vitals here so your vitals are normal your pulse ox is okay so everything's good with that so i'm gon na feel your neck on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any cervical lymphadenopathy no subclavicular adenopathy your heart exam regular rate and rhythm no murmur your lung exam so i do notice some crackles in your lungs bilaterally that's just a faint sound we hear when you take a deep breath so that could mean you have some fluid in there and that is to be expected due to your lung cancer diagnosis so i'm gon na look at your skin exam so on your skin exam on your chest i do see some erythema on the anterior aspect of your chest on the left side and that could be due to that radiation sometimes patients do get a radiation burn and it's it'll get better with time especially once you're done with the the radiation treatment and on your extremity it there is no lower extremity edema in your legs so prior to coming to see me you did get a chest x-ray it looks like you do have mild radiation umitis that means you have inflammation of your lungs due to the radiation so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so your first diagnosis you know is is the lung cancer so we are gon na continue you on that chemo regimen on that you do have continue on that that current radiation doses i think you're on forty five grade yep you're on that and then when the when the regimen's complete we'll do some more testing and hopefully we can see a resection of that tumor so that has just gotten little smaller and we can go inside and and take it out so for your second diagnosis the radiation pneumonitis i'm gon na prescribe you a low dose steroid prednisone forty milligrams one tablet a day for five days have you been on on a steroids before\n[patient] no i've only ever heard bad things about them they make people jittery and gain weight\n[doctor] i mean and and i for you that's that that's for patients that you know who are on them for a a long period of time right you're only gon na be on it for five days that should n't affect you too bad you might feel when you coming off of it after the five days a few muscle aches other than that you should be fine you should n't really experience much weight gain other other than not not much at all since you're only on on it for five days so but that's gon na help you reduce some of the inflammation in your lungs help you breathe better so we can continue the radiation treatment because we definitely need to do that because our most important thing right now is to try to decrease the size of that tumor okay and then for your third issue the oddy ophagia or it come terms the painful swallowing right you said you had that from the from the radiation so that's from the inflammation of your lungs that's kinda creeping up to your esophagus that's why you're you're feeling that pain so i'm gon na prescribe you a lidocaine squishy and swallow you can do that four times a day and so you'll do it and you'll be able to eat immediately afterwards because it would do some of that pain free from swallowing and that will help you taking liquids and food because we definitely need you well off it and and and hydrated while you're going through this cancer therapy okay\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] alright so do you have any questions for me\n[patient] no\n[doctor] alright so we will get you those medications those prescriptions and then we will see you back in two weeks\n[patient] okay great thank you\n[doctor] thanks\n</conversation>\nThe generated note will be provided in these tags:\n<response>\nHISTORY OF

have a kidney stone so can you tell me what's going on how are you feeling and you're my my patient\n[patient] and i'm your patient yeah\n[doctor] yeah\n[patient] i've been having pains let's just say for the last two weeks\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] it's it starts up in the right flank and radiates down to my groin and you know it it's under control but i have bouts where it kinda gets a little out of control\n[doctor] okay so is it is it a constant pain or does it come and go for you\n[patient] it comes and goes it depends on how much i've been drinking and you know what sort of activities i've been doing but it's still there\n[doctor] alright so have you noticed any pain when you've been urinating\n[patient] not really\n[doctor] okay have you noticed any blood in your urine\n[patient] no blood i did have an episode where the pain radiated to one of my testicles which was kinda weird but but yeah it it sort of calmed down a little bit in that regards\n[doctor] okay have you taken anything for the pain\n[patient] yeah i've been taking some ibuprofen and that kinda like calms it down a little bit but it persists\n[doctor] okay and what would you say like your pain score is out of ten\n[patient] it's probably a four out of ten when it gets a little more out of control for the most part it's probably in the order of one or two out of ten\n[doctor] okay so it is it's it's it's not too bad\n[patient] it's a new ones yeah but i know it's there it does n't go away\n[doctor] okay yeah yeah a lot of my patients you know have that that minor pain so you\n[patient] i'm a horrible active by the way\n[doctor] no yeah that's that's that's totally fine that's totally fine you know i'm just playing the doctor on tv so good good alright so have you had any other symptoms nausea vomiting anything like that\n[patient] no nausea no vomiting i had some i felt like it might have been like chills but no fevers nothing along those lines\n[doctor] okay that's good do you know anybody in your family that has had kidney stones in the past\n[patient] yeah all in my family has had kidney stones in the past\n[doctor] no well they did n't set you up good did they\n[patient] yeah i i i guess i can blame them but but yeah it's been a it's been an issue with the family for as long as i've been aware of\n[doctor] okay alright and i'm reading here it looks like you've had them before as well right\n[patient] i have yeah i passed some by myself and i've had to have surgery a couple of times as well\n[doctor] okay so the ones that you passed by yourself how many days would you say it would take to to pass\n[patient] usually within within a week i manage to to get them out\n[doctor] okay alright so you got anything fun plan for the weekend\n[patient] just getting this pain under control\n[doctor] okay well that that sounds like a good plan we can definitely help you out with that alright so i'm gon na do a quick physical exam on you looks like your blood pressure is a little bit elevated and i think that's probably because you're in pain and that's understandable everything else looks fine so on pressing on your abdomen does that hurt\n[patient] no no no pain\n[doctor] alright so press here in the back and your cva does that back here in\n[patient] yeah it's a little tender yeah it's little tender\n[doctor] okay so on your physical exam there seems to be no tenderness to palpation of your abdomen there is cva tenderness on your your right side here and that's due to that kidney stone so we did get a a ct scan before you came in so it does show that you have a stone measuring point five centimeters in size located on the proximal right ureter so that's that duct that passes from your kidney to your bladder i do n't see any evidence of high flow nephrosis so there is nothing obstructing causing swelling in your your kidney so that's good to hear so i do n't think you hopefully wo n't need any surgery for this one so let's talk a bit little bit about on my assessment and plan so you know you've done this a couple of times you have that kidney stone so what i want you to do is just have you continue to push fluids and hopefully we can pass the stone your pain your pain you're doing okay right now so i'm just gon na continue you on that ibuprofen do you think that's that's working you said for you\n[patient] so far so good but since the weekend is coming around i i i rather have something stronger if it's possible\n[doctor] okay so i can prescribe you some tramadol you know that should help fifty milligrams that should help you out if you do have any of that pain if you get any breakthrough pain from that you can take that ibuprofen it should help you you know with everything and hopefully you can get through that weekend i know you went to the your pcp prior to coming to see me did they give you a strainer\n[patient] they did they did yeah and i've been i've been using that but so far nothing\n[doctor] okay so continue to use the strainer whenever you urinate so hopefully we can catch the stone i'm also gon na order a bmp a urinalysis and urine culture and based on what that shows we can see if we need to put you on any antibiotics i do n't think you have an infection but you know there is that possibility and then i want to see you again in one to two weeks if you are still having symptoms and if you know you still have the stone with you we can talk about further treatment possible lithotripsy you know that's the shockwave treatment i'm pretty sure you've had that prior to\n[patient] yeah yeah yeah yeah that's what i want\n[doctor] what that is okay so do you have any other questions for me\n[patient] no i'm friend\n[doctor] alright so i'll see you again in two weeks i'll have my nurse come in and bring you that prescription for the tramadol and i think we are all good\n[patient] perfect thank you\n[doctor] alright great\n</conversation>\nThe generated note will be provided in these

He also recalls one episode in which the pain radiated down into one of his testicles. Although his pain is intermittent depending on his fluid intake and activity level, he rates the pain as a 4/10 at its worst. Otherwise, the pain is a 1-2/10. He denies any pain with urination, hematuria, nausea, vomiting, or fevers, but recalls possibly having chills at one point. Over-the-counter ibuprofen provides partial relief of his pain. Of note, the patient has a personal history of kidney stones, some which were passed independently, usually within a week, while others required surgical intervention or lithotripsy. He also has several family members with a histories of kidney stones.\n\nMEDICAL HISTORY\n\nThe patient has a personal history of kidney stones treated conservatively, surgically, and with lithotripsy.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY\n\nThe patient has a significant family history of kidney stones.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nConstitutional: Reports chills. Denies fever\nGastrointestinal: Denies nausea or vomiting.\nGenitourinary: Reports right flank pain. Denies dysuria or hematuria.\n\nVITALS\n\nBlood pressure: Slightly elevated\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nGI/GU: No tenderness to palpation of the abdomen.\nMSK: Examination of the right flank: CVA tenderness.\n\nRESULTS\n\nCT scan of the right flank was reviewed today, 05/06/2022. It revealed a kidney stone measuring 0.5 cm in size, located on the proximal right ureter. There is no evidence of hydronephrosis.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nKidney stone, right side.\n\nPLAN\n\nAfter reviewing the patient's examination and CT scan findings today, we discussed the diagnosis and treatment plan. I recommend that we treat the patient conservatively at this point. I advised him to continue drinking plenty of fluids so he can hopefully pass the stone. He has been controlling his pain with over-the-counter ibuprofen and should continue to do so. I also prescribed tramadol 50 mg for any breakthrough pain.

i am not great\n[doctor] you are okay you are not great okay well how long have you been having some shortness of breath\n[patient] it's been about a week\n[doctor] it's been about a week okay now have you ever experienced these symptoms before\n[patient] yeah this happened about six months ago and i came in and they changed my lasix dose and i seemed to get better\n[doctor] okay alright so let's talk a little bit about that now i know that you have a history of coronary disease you know you had had a heart attack back in twenty eighteen we put that stent in your right coronary artery i know that the pumping function of your heart was a little low you know that what we call that ejection fraction was about thirty five percent have you been watching your salt intake\n[patient] yeah but you know it's been the holidays the last couple of weeks and you know i we've had a bunch of family get togethers and i i do n't think my diet has been everything it should have been\n[doctor] okay alright now have you noticed any swelling in your legs\n[patient] yes definitely\n[doctor] okay and are you taking the lasix now i know that we had increased it to about forty milligrams once a day are you taking it\n[patient] yeah i take it everyday\n[doctor] you take it everyday okay do you notice that you're urinating any less recently\n[patient] no it seems about the same\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] you know i i urinate at night you know at least once sometimes twice a night that's a little more it happened before\n[doctor] okay alright and do you feel short of breath at rest or is it mostly when you're just walking around\n[patient] walking around stairs in particular walking quickly\n[doctor] okay and how about when you're sleeping at night are you able to lay flat or do you have to sit up a little bit\n[patient] i gone from one pillow to two pillows\n[doctor] okay alright and do you ever wake up really short of breath does it ever wake you up\n[patient] it did that six months ago it has not done that so far this time\n[doctor] okay alright now tell me a little bit about when was the last time you saw your nephrologist\n[patient] about about a month ago\n[doctor] okay because as you know you know we we do talk about the fact that you have some kidney dysfunction about stage three so it's gon na be important for you to continue to follow up with your kidney doctor now are you how are you doing staying away from things like motrin and advil i know that you had had some knee pain in the past and you know how are you doing staying away from those medications\n[patient] yeah everybody has told me not to use it so i do n't except when i have pretty bad pain i had an episode about a week ago some pain in my feet actually and i i had to take motrin to get rid of it so yeah i took motrin for a while and i stopped as quickly as i could\n[doctor] okay now are you able to take tylenol do you not feel any relief from tylenol when you take it\n[patient] yeah tylenol's lovely it just is not very effective\n[doctor] okay alright yeah because i think we really want you to stay away from that those anti-inflammatories because that can make your kidney function worse and obviously you know we do n't wan na see you go on dialysis or anything like that so we'll have\n[patient] mean neither\n[doctor] right so we'll have to you know really work on that now tell me a little bit about are you watching the potassium and stuff in your diet\n[patient] nobody's really talked to me about that so\n[doctor] okay yeah so you want\n[patient] i did n't know what high potassium foods are\n[doctor] okay i'm sorry i've never talked to you about that in the past i that's my fault so yeah so you wan na make sure you stay away from things like bananas oranges you know potatoes have lots of potassium that type of thing and so you know because with your kidney function you know that can cause your potassium levels to go up because you do n't get rid of the potassium as you should you know\n[patient] something to eat\n[doctor] what's that\n[patient] is there anything left is there anything left over that i ca n't eat\n[doctor] so yeah you can eat you know how about this how about we give you a a referral to a dietitian and they can help you with that\n[patient] sounds good\n[doctor] now are you watching the nba playoff should i or should i not bring that up i is that a sensitive subject i mean i'm a self expand and and we did sweep the nuts so\n[patient] yeah well i mean that's fan and i could n't sleep last night but you know\n[doctor] okay well maybe we should n't talk about\n[patient] kinda used to it you know where they where the favorite to win and then like that\n[doctor] yeah i know i i i will say i think jason tatum and jaylen brown paid played phenomenally so i do think that they help with the cell fix over the edge so but that's all we'll talk about that what's that\n[patient] i said yeah too bad they did\n[doctor] yeah alright well i wan na just go ahead and do a quick physical exam on you okay so you know looking at your vital signs here in the office you know your your blood pressure is about one thirty five over eighty so it's it's not too bad and maybe like to see it a little bit lower i'm just gon na be calling out my physical exam findings and i'm gon na let you know what they mean when i'm done okay so on your neck exam i appreciate some jugular venous distention up to about nine centimeters there are no carotid bruits on your lung exam i do appreciate bibasilar crackles with occasional rhonchi that clears when you cough on your heart exam i do appreciate a three out of six systolic ejection murmur heard at the left base and on your lower extremity exam i do appreciate one to two plus pitting edema bilaterally so frank what does that mean all that means is that you have findings on you that suggest that you're retaining fluid now we'll have to talk a little bit about how we're going to address that okay so i wan na just go over a little bit about my assessment and my plan for you okay so for the for your first problem of your shortness of breath i do believe you're having a an acute heart failure exacerbation so i wan na go ahead and increase your lasix from forty milligrams a day to eighty milligrams a day and i want you to call me in two days and let me know how your weight has been with increasing the diuretic now if you start to have worsening shortness of breath before that i want you to yeah call me we may have to admit you to the hospital for some intravenous diuretics okay i also wan na go ahead and just obtain\n[patient] salt on lasix all at once am i take it all at once or do i divide it up\n[doctor] how about you start taking the the increased dose in the morning and then we'll see how you do and if necessary i'll have to add a second dose in the afternoon that you can take around four o'clock in the afternoon i do n't want you to take it too late at night because then you will be going to the bathroom all night okay\n[patient] that sounds correct\n[doctor] so i also want to go ahead and order a chest x-ray just to make sure that we are not missing anything else okay for your second problem of your coronary artery disease you know it sounds like you're doing well except for this heart failure exacerbation so i wan na go ahead and order another echocardiogram to check out that heart murmur that i hear on your physical exam just to make sure that that's not getting any worse and to make sure that the pumping function of your heart is stable and i'm gon na go ahead and call doctor white and let them know that i want you to be seen by them okay okay and then for your third problem of your stage three chronic kidney disease i want you to go ahead and try to you know do n't please do n't take anymore motrin or advil i do want you to try to stick with tylenol and if you're still having a significant problem with with some pain i want you to call me and we'll talk about some alternative medications that we can use or therapies okay i will also want to go ahead and order a complete metabolic panel just to make sure that your kidney function is stable does that sound okay\n[patient] that sounds good do you have any idea what was going on with my foot pain before\n[doctor] well how long have you been having it how long you've been having that foot pain\n[patient] that's why i took the motrin it lasted you know four five days slowly went away\n[doctor] it was in both of your feet\n[patient] one\n[doctor] one and where in your foot was was it\n[patient] just in front of the big toe\n[doctor] just in front of the big toe okay have you ever had a history of gout\n[patient] nobody has told me about that\n[doctor] okay alright well it sounds like it could've been gout you know with your chronic kidneys chronic kidney disease it it's a possibility so for this possible gout flare for your fourth problem of your possible gout flare let's go ahead i wan na just go ahead and order a uric acid just to see and it's something that we can talk about there is an alternative medication that you can take with your kidney function that that would n't hurt it that would n't injure it any further and i think it would work just the same\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] okay any other questions\n[patient] just as long as you think i'm gon na get better\n[doctor] i think you're gon na get better yes i think we're gon na you know i really want you to watch your salt intake and i'm gon na go ahead and order that dietary dietitian referral so that you can get your diet under control but you really have to watch your salt intake i think that that's kind of what this heart failure exacerbation is about maybe a little dietary indiscretion\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] okay anything else\n[patient] yeah no that's good thank you\n[doctor] okay you're welcome bye\n</conversation>\nThe generated note will be provided in

There are no carotid bruits.\n\nRespiratory\n- Auscultation of Lungs: Bibasilar crackles with occasional rhonchi that clears when coughing.\n\nCardiovascular\n- Auscultation of Heart: 3 out of 6 systolic ejection murmur heard at the left base.\n\nMusculoskeletal\n- Examination of the lower extremities: 1 to 2+ pitting edema bilaterally.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN\n\n1. Acute heart failure exacerbation.\n- Medical Reasoning: The patient\u2019s physical examination today suggests he is retaining fluid. His shortness of breath is also the result of an acute heart failure exacerbation. His recent dietary indiscretion may have contributed to this development.\n- Patient Education and Counseling: I explained to the patient that he should increase his diuretic in the morning so that any increased urinary frequency will not interrupt his sleep at night. I encouraged the patient to limit his salt intake.\n- Medical Treatment: The patient will increase his Lasix from 40 mg a day to 80 mg a day. We will see how he does with the increased dose in the morning before adding a second increased dose in the afternoon. Chest x-ray ordered to rule out any other etiologies.\n\n2. Coronary artery disease.\n- Medical Reasoning: He is doing well except for the heart failure exacerbation.\n- Patient Education and Counseling: I advised the patient to limit his intake of salty foods.\n- Medical Treatment: Repeat echocardiogram ordered for further evaluation of the heart murmur heard on his physical exam. I am going to call Dr. White and let them know that I want him to be seen by them.\n\n3. Stage 3 chronic kidney disease.\n- Medical Reasoning: This appears to be stable.\n- Patient Education and Counseling: I reminded the patient it is important to routinely follow up with his nephrologist. I advised him that he should limit intake of any potassium rich foods including bananas, oranges, and potatoes as they can affect his kidney function. I also recommended he avoid the use of any anti-inflammatories such as Motrin or Advil as they can contribute to worsening kidney function. If his pain does not resolve with Tylenol, I want him to call me, and we can discuss some alternative medications or therapies.\n- Medical Treatment: The patient was provided with a referral to a dietician for assistance with his dietary needs. Tylenol can be taken for pain. Complete metabolic panel is ordered to ensure kidney function is stable.\n\n4. Possible gout flare.\n- Medical Reasoning: The patient\u2019s recent great toe pain may have been a possible gout flare related to his chronic kidney disease.\n- Patient Education and Counseling: I explained that there is an alternative medication he could take to protect his kidney function that would not result in a gout flare.\n- Medical Treatment: Uric acid test ordered.\n\nPatient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nI want him to call me in 2 days and let me know how his weight has been with increasing the diuretic. If he starts to have worsening shortness of breath in the next 2 days, I recommend he call me as we may have to admit him to the hospital for intravenous diuretics.\n</gold_response>\nCarefully review the <response> based on the <conversation> and compare it to the <gold_response> when needed.\n\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Does the note provide correct clinical information based on the conversation?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the note include all important medical details from the conversation?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the note written clearly and organized in a standard clinical format for clinicians\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

tags:\n<response>\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:\nCarolyn is a 49-year-old female presenting for follow-up of chronic conditions. She reports recent flare-ups of osteoarthritis primarily affecting her elbows, especially the right elbow, which have been exacerbated by increased computer use and prolonged sitting. She describes pain, swelling, tenderness, stiffness, and limited range of motion in the right elbow. She also reports occasional numbness and tingling in her hands during extended typing. Additionally, she has a history of gout, with a flare involving her toe approximately three months ago, which has been controlled with medication. Her psoriasis has remained stable, with improvement noted on topical therapy.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM:\nVital signs are within normal limits. No cervical lymphadenopathy observed. Cardiopulmonary exam reveals a regular heart rate and clear lungs. Examination of the right elbow shows edema, inflammation of the olecranon, tenderness, effusion, pain on palpation, and pain with pronation, supination, flexion, and extension. The elbow is also stiff. Abdomen is soft with no lower extremity edema. No other joint abnormalities noted.\n\nRESULTS:\nAutoimmune panel, ESR, and uric acid levels are within normal limits, indicating no systemic inflammatory or autoimmune activity. The physical exam confirms inflammation and tenderness localized to the right elbow, consistent with osteoarthritis. Gout appears to be stable based on clinical history and labs.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\n- Osteoarthritis of the right elbow: Continue meloxicam 15 mg once daily for pain and swelling. Order a right elbow X-ray to evaluate joint status before considering physical therapy.\n- Gout: Continue colchicine 0.6 mg twice daily as needed for flare-ups; gout remains stable.\n- Psoriasis: Continue topical steroid cream for scalp; condition remains under control.\n- No evidence of systemic autoimmune or inflammatory process.\nFollow-up after imaging results to determine further management, including potential referral for physical therapy. Patient advised to monitor symptoms and report any new or worsening issues.\n</response>\nThe reference note will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nCHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nFollow-up of chronic problem.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nMs. Carolyn Garcia is a 49-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for follow-up of her chronic problem.\n\nThe patient reports her osteoarthritis has been flaring up a little lately, and she would like to talk about that, primarily in her elbows. She states she has been sitting at the computer more in the office, so she is unsure if it is stagnant in that position all day. She notes her right elbow bothers her more than her left elbow, but she is primarily typing all day versus writing. She denies any other joint pain. She notes occasional numbness and tingling in her hands, which she tries to shake out her arms to relieve the numbness.\n\nShe also has a history of gout. Her last episode was about 3 months ago. She had some inflammation of her toe at that time. She denies any other issues with that. She states the medication she was given at that time helped with her gout and she has not seen a flare up since. She reports her psoriasis is under control and has not been a major problem for her either. She is still on colchicine 0.6 mg twice a day as needed for flare-ups of her gout.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\n\u2022 Musculoskeletal: Endorses joint pain.\n\u2022 Neurological: Endorses numbness and tingling.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION\n\n\u2022 Neck: Supple without lymphadenopathy.\n\u2022 Respiratory: Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.\n\u2022 Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm.\n\u2022 Gastrointestinal: Abdomen is soft.\n\u2022 Musculoskeletal: No edema to the lower extremity. Examination of\u00a0 the right elbow, there is some edema and inflammation of the right olecranon. Some tenderness to palpation of the olecranon bursa. Pain with pronation and supination. Pain with flexion and extension of the right arm.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN\n\nA 49-year-old female here today for followup of chronic problem.\n\n1. Gout\n\u2022 Medical Treatment: Continue colchicine 0.6 mg twice a day as needed for flare ups.\n\n2. Osteoarthritis\n\u2022 Medical Treatment: We will order a right elbow x-ray. We will prescribe meloxicam 15 mg once a day for pain and swelling.\n\n3. Psoriasis\n\u2022 Medical Treatment: Continue steroid cream.\n\nPatient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.\n\n</gold_response>\nCarefully review the <response> based on the <conversation> and compare it to the <gold_response> when needed.\n\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Does the note provide correct clinical information based on the conversation?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the note include all important medical details from the conversation?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the note written clearly and organized in a standard clinical format for clinicians\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

She reports the pain has been ongoing, likely due to repetitive trauma from desk work and typing. She denies numbness, tingling, weakness (except mild), fever, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting. She also reports nasal congestion from allergies. Her medical history includes epilepsy (well-controlled, last seizure a year ago on Keppra), depression (managed with therapy, feeling somewhat down but no suicidal ideation), and peptic ulcer disease (resolved after recent endoscopy showing gastritis). She denies recent systemic symptoms aside from joint issues.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM:\nVital signs are within normal limits. Examination of the left elbow reveals erythema, edema, warmth, tenderness to palpation of the olecranon, and pain with flexion and extension. The elbow is stiff but there is a palpable radial pulse. No other abnormalities noted on physical exam.\n\nRESULTS:\nX-ray of the left elbow shows no evidence of fracture. Recent endoscopy indicated gastritis, with resolution of prior ulcer disease. No other laboratory or imaging results discussed.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\n1. Left olecranon bursitis likely due to repetitive trauma; advised rest, icing, and prescribed meloxicam 15 mg once daily. Recommend using a pillow to offload the elbow.\n2. Epilepsy well-controlled; continue Keppra 500 mg twice daily with a refill ordered.\n3. Depression management; initiated on Lexapro 10 mg once daily, with plans to monitor response.\n4. Peptic ulcer disease resolved; continue Protonix 40 mg once daily before meals.\nPatient advised on symptom management and follow-up in a couple of weeks. No further questions.\n</response>\nThe reference note will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nCHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nJoint pain.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nThe patient is a 26-year-old female with a past medical history significant for epilepsy, depression, and peptic ulcer disease who presents with some joint pain.\n\nThe patient reports that her left elbow has really been bothering her. She states that she sits at her desk all day for work with her elbows bent. She reports that after work it is really hard for her to flex and extend her left elbow. She reports that it has been really stiff and painful. She also notes that she has noticed swelling on the olecranon of her elbow. She reports that she is right-handed, therefore, she can still write, which is great, but typing is difficult. She denies any numbness or tingling in her hands. She reports that she has some weakness in her arm but nothing too significant. She denies any fever or chills.\n\nRegarding her epilepsy, she reports that she has not had any recent seizures. She reports that her last seizure was a year ago. She reports that she is still taking Keppra.\n\nRegarding her depression, she reports that she started therapy last year and she is trying to avoid medications for this problem. She reports that therapy has been helpful, but she still feels down and stressed. She denies suicidal and homicidal ideations.\n\nRegarding her peptic ulcer, she reports that she was dealing with a lot of stress last year. She then underwent an endoscopy which showed that she had an episode of gastritis. She was subsequently diagnosed with peptic ulcer disease and started Protonix. She reports that she has not had any issues with her ulcer since the procedure and everything has been good.\n\nThe patient denies chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting. She reports that she does have a little bit of medial nasal congestion from allergies.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\n\u2022 Ears, Nose, Mouth and Throat: Endorses medial nasal congestion from allergies.\n\u2022 Cardiovascular: Denies chest pain or dyspnea on exertion.\n\u2022 Respiratory: Denies shortness of breath.\n\u2022 Musculoskeletal: Endorses left elbow joint pain, swelling, and weakness.\n\u2022 Psychiatric: Endorses depression.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION\n\n\u2022 Musculoskeletal: Examination of the left elbow reveals erythema and edema.

She denies radiation of pain down her legs or numbness. She has a history of prior lumbar fusion.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM:\nOn examination, no significant abnormalities are observed aside from tenderness and stiffness with rotation. No signs of radiculopathy are present. Lumbar range of motion is limited by pain, especially with twisting. Straight leg raise test is negative, and sensation to light touch is intact. No motor weakness or reflex abnormalities noted.\n\nRESULTS:\nRecent lumbar spine x-ray shows the previous fusion at T4; no evidence of compression fractures or other acute bony abnormalities. The fusion appears intact, and no significant degenerative changes are observed.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\nMrs. Lee likely has a lumbar strain related to twisting injury, with no signs of nerve compression or radiculopathy. She is advised to continue ibuprofen 800 mg three times daily with food, and to apply alternating ice and heat to the back. Encouraged to maintain walking activity. Symptoms are expected to improve over the next few days; if not, or if worsening occurs, she should return for follow-up within a week. No additional medications or interventions are necessary at this time. She has a history of anxiety, managed with medication.",

She reports jumping out from behind a hiding spot and falling down a small staircase, hitting her back against the railing. She describes the pain as worsened by twisting and when lying flat. She denies radiation of pain down her legs or numbness. She has a history of prior lumbar fusion.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM:\nOn examination, no significant abnormalities are observed aside from tenderness and stiffness with rotation. No signs of radiculopathy are present. Lumbar range of motion is limited by pain, especially with twisting. Straight leg raise test is negative, and sensation to light touch is intact. No motor weakness or reflex abnormalities noted.\n\nRESULTS:\nRecent lumbar spine x-ray shows the previous fusion at T4; no evidence of compression fractures or other acute bony abnormalities. The fusion appears intact, and no significant degenerative changes are observed.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\nMrs. Lee likely has a lumbar strain related to twisting injury, with no signs of nerve compression or radiculopathy. She is advised to continue ibuprofen 800 mg three times daily with food, and to apply alternating ice and heat to the back. Encouraged to maintain walking activity. Symptoms are expected to improve over the next few days; if not, or if worsening occurs, she should return for follow-up within a week. No additional medications or interventions are necessary at this time.

She states she was at a birthday party and she ran her back into the railing of the staircase and twisted her back. She denies any pain radiating down her legs. Lying flat and twisting motions aggravate the pain. She is currently taking ibuprofen.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS:\n\nIbuprofen.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\n\nAnxiety.\n\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY:\n\nLumbar fusion\n\nEXAM\n\nExamination of the back shows range of motion without pain. Straight leg raise is negative. Sensation is intact.\n\nRESULTS\n\nX-rays of the lumbar spine show no obvious signs of acute fracture. Evidence of a prior lumbar fusion with hardware in good position.\n\nIMPRESSION\n\nLumbar spine strain.\n\nPLAN\n\nAt this point, I discussed the diagnosis and treatment options with the patient.

She reports that over the past month, she has increased her swimming activity, specifically using the breaststroke, and has experienced worsening pain in her right knee after a few laps. The pain is localized to the knee and worsens with certain movements, particularly during patellar compression and when the knee is stiffened. She denies any recent trauma, injury, or twisting of the knee. She notes that her back pain has been stable and her depression is well-controlled.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM:\nVital signs are unremarkable. Examination of the right knee reveals tenderness with range of motion, especially during patellar compression, and pain with patellar inhibition and when the leg is stiffened. No swelling or joint effusion is noted. Range of motion is limited by pain. Strength testing shows no deficits, but pain is elicited during specific maneuvers. No signs of ligamentous instability. The rest of the physical exam, including cardiovascular, respiratory, thyroid, and neurological assessments, is normal.\n\nRESULTS:\nA right knee X-ray was reviewed, showing normal joint structures without evidence of fracture, dislocation, or degenerative changes. The clinical findings suggest chondromalacia of the patella, likely due to overuse from increased swimming activity.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\nThe patient has chondromalacia of the patella secondary to overuse. Management includes initiating NSAIDs (ibuprofen 600 mg four times daily with food), and performing straight leg raising exercises to strengthen the quadriceps. She is advised to avoid activities that increase knee pressure, such as lunges and breaststroke swimming, and to consider alternative strokes with less knee strain or rest. If symptoms persist beyond two weeks, follow-up is recommended. Her chronic back pain remains stable, and she is advised to continue swimming as tolerated. Her depression is stable on current medication, and her carpal tunnel syndrome remains well-controlled. No additional interventions are necessary at this time.",

She reports feeling tired, lacking energy, and experiencing joint pain and swelling in both elbows. She also reports body aches, nausea, and a recent rash resembling a bull's-eye on her abdomen. She denies fever, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or other systemic symptoms. Her blood sugars have been relatively stable, with some fluctuations, and her blood pressure is well-controlled.\n\n**PHYSICAL EXAM:**  \nVital signs are within normal limits, with no fever. Physical exam reveals bilateral elbow joint swelling and tenderness. Skin examination shows a warm, non-tender bull's-eye rash on the left abdomen. No other rashes or skin abnormalities noted. Heart and lung exams are unremarkable.\n\n**RESULTS:**  \nLyme titer is elevated, confirming recent or ongoing infection. Laboratory results, including white blood cell count, are within normal limits. No other abnormal labs noted. The physical exam findings support the diagnosis of early Lyme disease.\n\n**ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:**  \n- **Lyme Disease:** Prescribe doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 3 weeks. Consult infectious disease specialist for further management if needed. Follow-up in one week.  \n- **Type 2 Diabetes:** Order hemoglobin A1c to assess glycemic control; continue metformin.  \n- **Hypertension:** Continue lisinopril 10 mg daily; monitor blood pressure at home; order lipid panel.  \n- **Additional:** Refill lisinopril as needed. Educate patient on medication adherence and symptom monitoring. Schedule follow-up appointment.\n</response>\nThe reference note will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nCHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nAbnormal labs.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nThe patient is a 31-year-old female with a past medical history significant for type 2 diabetes, and hypertension who presents with abnormal labs. She had an insect bite at her last visit after hiking in the woods. We drew a Lyme titer which came back positive.\n\nThe patient reports she has been feeling tired and lacking a lot of energy. She also notes swollen elbow joints, body aches, bullseye rash, and nausea. She states she has not been able to eat much. What she does eat has been bland foods such as crackers. She denies any high fevers.\n\nRegarding her type 2 diabetes, she states her blood sugars have been okay. She notes they are sometimes a little high or low, but nothing too far out of range. She is still taking metformin.\n\nRegarding her hypertension, she is monitoring her blood pressure at home and it has been good. She is avoiding salty foods and is still taking lisinopril.\n\nThe patient denies abdominal pain and diarrhea.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\n\u2022 Constitutional: Denies fevers. Endorses fatigue.\n\u2022 Gastrointestinal: Denies abdominal pain and diarrhea. Endorses nausea.\n\u2022 Musculoskeletal: Endorses bilateral elbow joint swelling, pain. Endorses body aches.\n\u2022 Integumentary: Endorses a rash.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION\n\n\u2022 Gastrointestinal: Examination of her abdomen reveals warmth to palpation. Nontender to palpation. No evidence of cellulitis.\n\u2022 Musculoskeletal: Swelling and pain to palpation of elbow joints bilaterally.\n\u2022 Integumentary: Small bullseye rash on the left abdominal quadrant.\n\nRESULTS\n\nLyme titer: elevated.\n\nLabs: WBC is within normal limits. All other labs are normal as well.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN\n\nThe patient is a 31-year-old female with a past medical history significant for type 2 diabetes, and hypertension who presents with abnormal labs.\n\nNewly diagnosed Lyme disease.\n\u2022 Medical Reasoning: This is a new issue for her. She presented with an insect bite at her last visit, and her subsequent lyme titer was elevated.\n\u2022 Medical Treatment: I am going to prescribe doxycycline 100 mg twice a day for 3 weeks. I am going to touch base with an infectious disease doctor to ensure nothing else that needs to be done. I want to see her again next week for follow-up for this.\n\nHypertension.\n\u2022 Medical Reasoning: This has been well-controlled based on home monitoring. She has been compliant with dietary modifications including limiting her sodium intake.\n\u2022 Additional Testing: I am going to order a lipid panel.\n\u2022 Medical Treatment: She will continue lisinopril 10 mg a day. This was refilled today.\n\u2022 Patient Education and Counseling: I advised the patient to continue to regularly monitor her blood pressures at home.\n\nDiabetes type 2.\n\u2022 Medical Reasoning: She has noticed intermittent elevations of her blood glucose levels but has been compliant with the use of metformin. Her diet has been limited due to nausea in the setting of Lyme disease.\n\u2022 Additional Testing: I am going to order a hemoglobin A1c to ensure no medication changes are needed.\n\nPatient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.\n\n</gold_response>\nCarefully review the <response> based on the <conversation> and compare it to the <gold_response> when needed.\n\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Does the note provide correct clinical information based on the conversation?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the note include all important medical details from the conversation?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the note written clearly and organized in a standard clinical format for clinicians\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

            "explanation": "The note closely reflects the conversation: symptoms (fatigue, nausea, body aches, bilateral elbow swelling/pain), exam (bull's-eye rash on left abdomen, warm and non-tender; vitals afebrile), labs (elevated Lyme titer; other labs including WBC normal), and plan (doxycycline 100 mg BID x3 weeks, ID consult, 1-week follow-up, A1c, lipid panel, continue metformin and lisinopril). Minor discrepancies include describing the exposure as a \"tick bite\" (conversation said \"insect bite\"), stating the titer \"confirms\" infection (clinically acceptable but slightly stronger than the doctor's phrasing about further testing), and noting \"refill lisinopril as needed\" rather than that it was refilled today."

She reports no pain in other joints and denies systemic symptoms such as fever, chills, nausea, or vomiting. She has a history of rotator cuff repair on the right shoulder two years ago, with no current shoulder issues. She is concerned about joint pain potentially related to her diabetes and reports that her blood sugars are well-controlled. She denies swelling or pins and needles in her feet but monitors for such symptoms due to her diabetes. She also has a history of hypertension, which is currently well-managed.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM:\nVital signs show elevated blood pressure, likely due to nervousness. Physical exam reveals a soft neck with no thyroid enlargement, a regular heart rate and rhythm, clear lungs, and a soft abdomen. Examination of the knees shows slight erythema and edema on the left, with a small effusion and decreased flexion and extension. Lower extremity strength is intact. No other joint abnormalities are noted.\n\nRESULTS:\nLeft knee x-ray appears normal, indicating no structural abnormalities. Laboratory results show a normal white blood cell count, suggesting no infection. The patient's HbA1c is mildly elevated, consistent with her diabetes management. Blood pressure readings are elevated today, but her overall control is stable.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\nJanet's bilateral knee pain may be due to strain or mild inflammation; no evidence of infection or significant structural damage. Plan includes ordering autoimmune labs to evaluate for inflammatory causes, initiating anti-inflammatory medication (meloxicam 15 mg daily), and referring her to physical therapy. She will continue her current diabetes regimen (metformin 500 mg twice daily) and monitor her blood pressure at home, reporting back in a few weeks. A lipid profile will be ordered to assess cardiovascular risk. She is advised to continue her hypertension medication (Norvasc 5 mg daily) and maintain blood pressure monitoring. No additional joint or systemic symptoms are reported. Follow-up will be scheduled after labs and therapy to reassess her condition.",

like , what are your next steps ?\n[patient] so , hopefully i'm going to be enlisted early spring of 2022 . so that gives me about six to seven months to get to a point where i'm able to exert my body where i do n't really need the inhaler . or at least show them that i have it under control .\n[doctor] now when you were in the other room you completed a breathing test , correct ?\n[patient] correct .\n[doctor] okay , great . so now let me ask you about the allergies , 'cause i know typically you'll use the zyrtec in the spring , summer and fall , correct ?\n[patient] yeah , i do n't really ... um , or i'm sorry , i use it more during the spring and fall . i do n't really have to use it too much in the summer .\n[doctor] do you use it more just as needed in the summer ?\n[patient] yeah , that's right .\n[doctor] okay . and have you been taking the zyrtec every day recently since you're right in the mix of spring ?\n[patient] not every day , but i do take it on days i know i'm going to be outside a lot . um , i do tend to work outside about three days a week so i'll definitely take it on those days .\n[doctor] and does it seem to work pretty well still ? are you happy with it ?\n[patient] yeah , it does , it works great .\n[doctor] wonderful , good to hear . and then i'm assuming you're staying away from the peanuts . uh , last year you had told me it worked with ... uh , you worked with enterprise rent-a-car and one of the cars had a lot of peanuts in it that you were cleaning out and that gave you hives , uh , when you had touched it , is that correct ?\n[patient] yep , that's correct .\n[doctor] okay . and has there been anything like that since that experience ?\n[patient] no , i do n't think so . i definitely became more cautious after that , so i usually wear , uh , wear long sleeves and change my gloves every time now . so i have n't had a reaction , but i imagine that i probably came into contact with cars that had peanuts in them , but they just d- did n't touch my skin .\n[doctor] super . and it sounds like you're really smart about it .\n[patient] yeah , and the airplanes , they have peanuts . they give everyone too , so .\n[doctor] okay . and you have an epipen that k- that you keep with you , correct ?\n[patient] yes .\n[doctor] okay . and i'm assuming you're going to need refills , um , i can call you in a new set for the year . typically of course , they expire within a year .\n[patient] yeah , okay .\n[doctor] and i remember , um , sometime previously you've had some testing for tree nuts , but you do have almonds and cashews , correct ? and- and you do okay with them , or do you avoid all tree nuts ?\n[patient] i do tend to avoid all of them but i recall eating some almonds at one point , uh , really soon after we discussed i might not be allergic to tree nuts anymore .\n[doctor] okay .\n[patient] and i remember having them and nothing happened , but i usually just tend to stay away from them , um , really if i can help it .\n[doctor] okay . so sometimes when people have a peanut allergy , the nuts in general just are n't very important to them , so it is very common to avoid both . um , so let's do this . i'll have helen come in and i would love to complete a breathing test on you . if your breathing numbers are looking great we can work on getting you , uh , something lower than wixela . if you look at all of our asthma regimens it is a stepwise process , and wixela is a combination of two medications in one . and , well maybe you do n't need both of'em . uh , maybe you just need one of'em . so we can work our way backwards .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] and so the breathing test will help give us some- some more guidance , we will look at the results in just a moment .\n[patient] all right , and so this past year i did get into the bad habit of vaping and smoking , but i have been trying to cut that out . so i should be good , and , um , now i only do just a little bit and i am trying to quit . so i am sure that might have an effect .\n[doctor] it can . um , so what we can do today is compare your results with prior results , probably before you started smoking or using the vape .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] yeah . and we'll see where you stand at that point .\n[patient] all right , that sounds good .\n[doctor] well let me go ahead and listen , so hop on up here for me .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] all right so your ears look good , a little bit of wax on both sides . can i see inside your mouth ? big ahh .\n[patient] ahh .\n[doctor] good . okay let me take a peek in your nose . all right , good . you can put your mask back on .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] and go ahead take a big breath in and out . good , your lungs sound terrific . i'll listen to your heart , breathe quietly . okay very good .\n[patient] awesome .\n[doctor] so your breathing test is about the same as it was a couple years ago , and actually looks a little bit better . you may not remember but when we last completed the test in 2019 , uh , do you recall if you were feeling lousy at the time ?\n[patient] i think it was the smoke . there were so many fires at that point and i remember coming in and looking out the window and all you saw was the orange and the smoke .\n[doctor] yes , you're absolutely right , that was a bad year . that was my first fall here and i was really alarmed . well that explains why at that time your numbers were a little bit lower and today they look better . here's what i think , so you'll have kaiser currently , correct ?\n[patient] correct .\n[doctor] okay . most insurances do limit what we can use .\n[patient] yeah i do know that .\n[doctor] okay so option one would be to continue using wixela like you're using it now . we would classify it as off-label and you can use it once a day instead of twice a day , which is fine . some people do that because they just need it once a day , so that's an option . option two would be to actually back up to an inhaler that just has one med .\n[patient] mm-hmm\n[doctor] so the one that kaiser covers is alvesco . the thing about alvesco , though , is that it would be two puffs in the morning and two puffs at night . so it's a bit more work . um , it's not breath activated but we could step down the lowest dose to see how you do . some of the newer guidelines for asthma that were published this year is recommending trying to treat people with inhalers like wixela or alvesco only when you're ill , or say during smoke season . so minimizing their use to those periods of time versus all year . unless you found out that you're getting\n[ inaudible 00:09:25 ] sick having issues every month , then that would indicate would pull back too much .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] that we had too much , yeah .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] um , so we could step back and possibly get you to the point where you just use those inhalers , uh , when you're ill or it's smoke season , but at the first step to do any of that would be to try to drop down to just alvesco .\n[patient] okay , that actually sounds really good .\n[doctor] okay great . so i will call that in for you , it will be the lower dose , 80 mcg , and you'll have to do two puffs twice a day .\n[patient] all right\n[doctor] okay and that'll be on the box when i call it in . you can put the wixela off to the side , but do n't throw it away just in case the alvesco does n't work well for you .\n[patient] okay , got it .\n[doctor] and then ideally we would repeat your breathing test in four months to see how you're doing , and then be able to document that you're doing well . sometimes , not always , the military will require documentation on breathing tests .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] is your pharmacy still the same or did you update it with helen ?\n[patient] yeah i believe she updated it . it should be kaiser permanente broadway .\n[doctor] okay perfect . i'll make sure it's the alvesco and then i'll renew your albuterol and epipen as well .\n[patient] awesome , thank you .\n[doctor] you're welcome . uh , then the zyrtec , do you pick it up over the counter or do get- do you get it as a prescription ?\n[patient] i just get it over the counter .\n[doctor] okay got it . and do you have a nebulizer that you would , uh , need refills on ?\n[patient] i do n't think i need any refills , i have n't used that in such a long time . i think the last time was when i had bronchitis , or there was few select times when i had to use it when i was kid .\n[doctor] okay good . well i think we have our game plan .\n[patient] okay awesome .\n[doctor] and do the alvesco two puffs twice a day and your albuterol if you need it . the zyrtec 10 milligrams as you need it and continue to stay away from peanuts and tree nuts and i'll refill your epipen .\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] all right so we've got it .\n[patient] great .\n[doctor] all right i'll have you take this to the front and i'm gon na say four months re-check for asthma and we'll repeat the spirometer- spirometry at that time .\n[patient] okay sounds good .\n[doctor] all right well thanks so much and you have a great day .\n[patient] you too .\n[doctor] and we'll do a follow-up in four months with act and spirometry , sooner if needed . follow-up 25 minutes .\n</conversation>\nThe generated note will be provided in these tags:\n<response>\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:\nEmily Hernandez, a 20-year-old female, presents for her annual follow-up for asthma, allergic rhinitis, and food allergy.

Due to insurance changes during the interim of our last office appointment from 04/2020, she was switched from Symbicort to Wixela. She uses Zyrtec in the spring, summer, and fall for her seasonal allergy symptoms, which tends to work well. She has known peanut and tree nut allergies, which she tries to avoid. She does tolerate almonds and cashew.\n\nMrs. Hernandez is trying to join the military, who require a certain fitness level without use of a rescue or maintenance inhaler, so she has been weaning off her inhalers. She uses albuterol prior to a run, but otherwise functions without it. She has been reducing her Wixela dose, using 1 inhalation once daily 3 times per week, with remaining days using it twice per day as prescribed. She feels this is working well. She denies urgent care or emergency room visits for respiratory issues in the past year. She denies requiring prednisone for breathing issues in the past year.\n\nShe hopes to be enlisted in the military in early spring of 2022. She is currently undergoing exertional testing to this purpose. She explains that this gives hers 6 to 7 months to show that she can exert herself without needing any inhalers.\n\nOver the past year, she admits to vaping and smoking, though she is trying to quit and has cut down her use significantly.\n\nShe notes having a nebulizer but denies needing it recently and has only used it in her past for upper respiratory infections and as a child a few times.\n\nMrs. Hernandez uses Zyrtec during the spring and fall but does not typically have to use it consistently during the summer. She confirms she has been taking Zyrtec 3 days per week when she works outside, and it works well to control her symptoms.\n\nShe has been successfully avoiding peanuts. Incident from last year was reviewed where she was exposed to peanuts when she was cleaning an Enterprise rental car that had a lot of peanuts in it. She developed contact hives when the peanuts encountered her skin. Over the past year she denies additional accidental exposures. She wears long sleeves and changes her gloves between each cleaning. She thinks it is likely that she has been in contact with cars that contained peanuts, but due to her protective measures she did not touch them directly. She confirmed she always keeps an EpiPen with her.\n\nThe patient is also avoiding tree nuts. She did ingest almonds without issue following our discussion that she could try them. Despite tolerating them well, she continues to avoid all tree nuts.\n\nPAST HISTORY\n\nMedical\nAsthma.\nAllergy rhinitis.\nFood allergies to peanut and tree nuts.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nCurrently smokes tobacco and vapes, trying to reduce and interested in cessation in preparation for joining the army.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS\n\nWixela Inhub 250 mcg-50 mcg/dose powder for inhalation. 1 puff 2 times daily in the morning and evening.\nProair HFA as needed.\nEpiPen as needed.\nAlvesco 80 mcg 2 puff 2 times daily.\n\nALLERGIES\n\nPeanuts cause a severe, anaphylactic reaction.\nMontelukast sodium, \u201cseizure-like\u201d reaction.\n\nRESULTS\n\nAsthma Control Test (ACT) Results: ACT score is 21.\nCurrent food skin test sensitivities include peanuts.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\n\u2022 Moderate persistent asthma, uncomplicated.\n\u2022 Allergic rhinitis.\n\u2022 Anaphylactic reaction due to peanuts.\n\nEmily Hernandez is a 20-year-old female who presented today for her yearly follow-up appointment for asthma, allergic rhinitis, and food allergy.\n\nPLAN\n\nModerate persistent asthma, uncomplicated\nThe patient has been using Wixela inhaler daily and admits to reducing her daily dose to one puff per day, 3-4 days per week as she feels she does not always need it the full dose. Additionally, she aspires to join the military and she must meet certain physical fitness requirements without the use of her inhaler. I counseled the patient on current asthma treatment guidelines which recommend using Wixela and Alvesco only when needed during periods of illness. The patient agreed to reducing her medicine to Alvesco which is a single medication, versus 2 in Welixa. The patient will continue to use her albuterol inhaler as needed. Her ACT score is 21 today and her spirometry test today was better than it was in 2019, though she recalls that it was smoky from wildfires during her last breathing test.\n\nAllergic rhinitis\nShe will continue to use Zyrtec as needed, primarily during spring and fall and sometimes in summer. Her current dose cadence is 3 times per week when she works outside. Symptoms are currently under control.\n\nAnaphylactic reaction due to peanuts\nThe patient has successfully avoided peanuts. Plan is to continue with current methods to avoid exposure. I will refill her EpiPen which expires annually.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nModerate persistent asthma, uncomplicated\nStart Alvesco, 2 puffs twice daily. Keep Wixela in case Alvesco does not work well. Continue albuterol as needed. Return in 4 months to repeat ACT and spirometry testing.\n\nAllergic rhinitis\nContinue Zyrtec 10 mg daily as needed.\n\nAnaphylactic reaction due to peanuts\nContinue strict avoidance of peanuts. I will refill her EpiPen today.\n</gold_response>\nCarefully review the <response> based on the <conversation> and compare it to the <gold_response> when needed.\n\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Does the note provide correct clinical information based on the conversation?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the note include all important medical details from the conversation?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the note written clearly and organized in a standard clinical format for clinicians\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

    "predicted_text": "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:\nJordan Roberts is a 49-year-old male with a history of hypertension and recent episodes of palpitations. He reports experiencing a hypertensive emergency in the emergency room in March, which he attributes to caffeine intake and lack of breakfast, possibly a panic attack. He denies recurrent palpitations since then. He has had longstanding hypertension, with family history of high blood pressure. Despite being on three antihypertensive medications, his blood pressure remains elevated, averaging 146-155 mm Hg. He is actively monitoring his blood pressure at home and is attempting lifestyle modifications, including reducing salt intake and walking on the treadmill regularly.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM:\nVital signs and physical exam were unremarkable. Heart and lung auscultation were normal. No peripheral edema or ankle swelling was observed. The patient reports no pain or discomfort during exam.\n\nRESULTS:\nRecent potassium level was 4.0 mmol/L. Blood pressure readings at home are consistently elevated (146-155 mm Hg). No recent electrolyte panels or additional labs have been performed since the last visit. Thyroid profile from March 2021 was requested for review. No signs of organ damage or secondary causes identified on physical exam.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\nThe patient has resistant hypertension, currently on three antihypertensive medications at maximum doses, with persistent elevated blood pressure. The plan includes adding spironolactone to his regimen to target potential hyperaldosterone-driven hypertension. Blood tests, including a metabolic panel, will be performed in two weeks to monitor electrolytes, especially potassium and sodium. The patient was counseled on medication side effects, including electrolyte disturbances and gynecomastia, and the importance of hydration. Lifestyle modifications continue to be emphasized, including adherence to the DASH diet, salt restriction (<1500-2000 mg/day), and regular aerobic exercise. Follow-up is scheduled in two weeks to assess blood pressure response and laboratory results. If blood pressure remains uncontrolled, referral to the resistant hypertension clinic for further evaluation and possible procedural interventions, such as renal denervation, will be considered.",

. please copy forward his thyroid profile from march 1st , 2021 .\n[doctor] hello mr. roberts , how are you doing today ?\n[patient] i'm fine , thank you .\n[doctor] good . good . so , i saw you were recently in the emergency room with high blood pressure and some palpitations .\n[patient] yeah . that was back in march i think , but my girlfriend and i , we talked about it , and on that day i had a few cups of coffee , and no breakfast . so , i think it was probably more of a panic attack than anything else .\n[doctor] yeah . have you , uh , have you felt it again since ?\n[patient] uh , no .\n[doctor] okay . uh , so tell me about the blood pressure then .\n[patient] well , i've had issues with my blood pressure since i was young .\n[doctor] do you have a family history of this ?\n[patient] yeah . a lot of my family does have high blood pressure .\n[doctor] i see .\n[patient] yeah , i thought it was getting better , and , uh , i have a new primary doctor , and she put me on a new medication about a month ago .\n[doctor] uh , can you tell me which medications you're taking ?\n[patient] my new med is , uh , a combo med , something 40-25 .\n[doctor] okay . um . yes , i see that in your chart . the benicar hct . it has hydrochlorothiazide in it .\n[patient] yeah , that's it . my water pill i call it .\n[doctor] okay . are you still taking the amlodipine , 10 milligrams daily ?\n[patient] uh , yes i am .\n[doctor] that's- that's a good start on a regimen . are you checking your blood pressure at home , and if yes , what numbers are you seeing ?\n[patient] um , every day .\n[doctor] awesome .\n[patient] yeah . every morning , i take it when i get up , and it's been running at about , uh , 146 to 155 lately .\n[doctor] so you're not down in the 120s yet ?\n[patient] no , not yet . well , we're trying to get there though .\n[doctor] okay . uh , how are you doing with your salt intake ?\n[patient] i'm trying to back off of it . i think i'm doing good with it , not eating too much .\n[doctor] good , uh , it plays a huge part in lowering your pressure and , uh , staying away from salt is important . um , i'll give you some information on the dash eating plan , which is the only eating plan that has been shown to lower blood pressure .\n[patient] sounds good .\n[doctor] are you doing any exercise ?\n[patient] i do try to walk on the treadmill when i can .\n[doctor] okay , great . um , all right . so , let's take a look .\n[patient] all right .\n[doctor] uh , you're gon na hear me talk throughout your exam , just so i can make sure i get everything documented .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] so , use my general physical exam template . let me take a listen to you and make sure everything sounds good .\n[patient] all right .\n[doctor] your heart and lungs sound good , so that's great .\n[patient] good to hear .\n[doctor] all right . go ahead and lie down . uh , and let me know if anywhere i press hurts .\n[patient] nope . nowhere .\n[doctor] all right . so , i'm gon na take a look at your ankles and feet . i'm just gon na look for some swelling .\n[patient] all right .\n[doctor] all right . it all looks good . go ahead and sit up . so , in terms of getting that pressure down , you're on three meds that are maxed out and your blood pressure is still not down . and , the question is what do we need to do to get your- to get it down . uh , your potassium one week ago was 4.0 . uh , has it been redone since in the last week ?\n[patient] uh , no .\n[doctor] okay . uh , four is good for your potassium level , some people have what is called resistant hypertension that is driven by something else in their body , uh , often it is a form , uh , hormonal response . if i were to take 10 people under the age of 50 who have high blood pressure who developed it at a young age , eight out of 10 would respond to reduced salt in their diet with a lower blood pressure . but , for the two out of 10 , there is something else driving it , uh , parathyroid levels or something called your adrenal glands overproduce , um , aldosterone , which we call hyperaldosterone .\n[patient] okay . so , is there something we can do about it ?\n[doctor] um , in these cases , there's medicine called , uh , spironolactone , that is very effective at dropping the ald- aldosterone level , and your blood pressure , and i think we should give that a try .\n[patient] all right . i mean , i'm willing to give it a try .\n[doctor] okay . so , let's discuss the piss- the possible risk of , uh , being on hydrochlorothiazide , which is the fluid med that you're now on . and , the spironolactone . one issue is that they can affect your electrolyte balance . um , they can also cause dehydration . so , when ... so , you got ta make sure that you hydrate . if you do not hydrate , and you get dehydrated , you will know it because you will get dizzy standing up . um , second thing is the spironolactone can raise your potassium too far , it's rare , but it can . uh , you're starting with your potassium at four , so that gives us some room .\n[patient] all right . i guess that makes me feel a little bit better .\n[doctor] yeah . and then the third thing is that spironolactone combined with hydrocholorozide- chlorothiazide can cause your sodium levels to go down . now , this does not mean- mean that you need to be eating more salt , okay ? but , it does mean that you will need to do blood tests in two weeks to make sure that it's okay .\n[patient] all right . no , that i can do . um , are there any other side effects i need to worry about ?\n[doctor] uh , dizziness possibly , as well as , uh , one in 100 guys might develop tenderness in their chest , swollen breasts , or enlarged breasts . this is a rare side effect , um , called gynecomastia , and if it happens , you just cut the medication and you let me know , but it is very uncommon .\n[patient] i'll definitely let you know if that happens .\n[doctor] okay . uh , we'll keep working at it until your blood pressure gets better . um , it can be tricky when your blood pressure starts to go up at a young age though , it is important to get it under control because it can lead to your heart getting bigger or enlarged . um , same thing that happens when you lift weights and your muscles get bigger , uh , and if your heart pumps against high blood pressure , it can eventually lead to heart failure .\n[patient] i understand .\n[doctor] yeah , so getting that under control is really important to help prevent kidney failure , strokes , and- and things like that- that you're at high risk for with high blood pressure .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] um , the american heart association has a website called heart.org , it has a lot of really good information about blood pressure to teach- to teach you about it and how to control your diet with exercise . um , if you do your treadmill routinely for 30 minutes or so most days , that could be seven to 10 points off your blood pressure .\n[patient] really ? i did n't realize that .\n[doctor] yeah , yeah . it's very important to be active , lower your salt , and increase your potassium . um , the goal is to keep your salt under 2000 milligrams a day , the actual recommendation is- is 1500 milligrams per day , but most people have a hard time with that . um , so just take a look at the website and the dash diet information . um , that will give you a lot of tips and information to help you start learning about this stuff .\n[patient] okay . i'll definitely check that out .\n[doctor] all right . so , we'll try the spironolactone and schedule a followup in two weeks to check your blood pressure and electrolytes . uh , if the new med does n't work , the next up is going to be the resistant hypertension clinic .\n[patient] all right .\n[doctor] all right . so , there they will look into secondary causes of your hypertension . they have access to newer procedure based technologies that can lower your blood pressure without medication , uh , for example , there is something called a renal , uh , denervation , uh , where they go inside the artery that feeds your kidney with almost like a little coil and heat that artery up . when they do that , they can block the nerve endings that get into your kidneys and lower your blood pressure .\n[patient] that's interesting .\n[doctor] yeah . so , that procedure has been shown to lower blood pressure by 10 points . um , there are of course some risks , so not everyone is a candidate . uh , but we'll cross that road , uh , when we need to , and let's just- let's just see how you do with the addition of the medication .\n[patient] sounds good to me .\n[doctor] all right . so , we will see you in two weeks then .\n[patient] sounds good . thanks doc .\n[doctor] yeah , you're welcome . let me know if you have any questions .\n[patient] will do .\n[doctor] all right . have a great day mr. roberts .\n[patient] you too .\n[doctor] mr. roberts presents with resistant hypertension . he's on three meds and maximum dose . i have added spironolactone to his regiment . we will need to monitor his potassium and sodium . he will have a metabolic panel and blood pressure check in two weeks . uh , next medication would be carvedilol , uh , which i try to avoid giving , it's potential for erectile dysfunction . i have talked to the patient about that , and the potential side effects of spironolactone , including the gynecomastia and electrolyte disturbances . if he is not controlled on spironolactone , the next step would be sending him to resistant hypertension clinic .\n</conversation>\nThe generated note will be provided in these tags:\n<response>\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:\nJordan Roberts is a

He attributed this to a panic attack, but also stated he consumed several cups of coffee on an empty stomach the morning of. He denies additional episodes of palpitations.\n\nHe has been monitoring his blood pressure at home daily, obtaining systolic blood pressure readings of 146 to 155. He does report a family history of hypertension. Additionally, he has been monitoring his salt intake and feels he is doing well at reducing it. He also walks on his treadmill as often as he can.\n\nHe has a new primary care physician who started him on a new medication Benicar HCT, which he has been using for the past month.\n\nPAST HISTORY\n\nMedical\nHypertension.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY\n\nSeveral family members positive for hypertension.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS\n\nBenicar HCT 40 mg/25 mg\nAmlodipine 10 mg daily.\n\nPhysical Examination\n\nCardiovascular\nNormal rate, regular rhythm, S2 normal, normal heart sounds, and normal pulses.\n\nPulmonary/Chest\nBreath sounds normal. \n\nAbdominal\nThere is no tenderness.\n\nMusculoskeletal\nThere is no edema.\n\nRESULTS\n\nThyroid profile 03/01/2021.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\n\u2022 Resistant hypertension.\n\nMr. Roberts presents with resistant hypertension, with systolic blood pressure readings between 146-155. He is currently on maximal doses for 3 medications.\n\nPLAN\n\nI have added spironolactone to his regimen which will require monitoring of his potassium and sodium. We will schedule him for a follow up in 2 weeks to complete a basic metabolic panel and check his blood pressure. Next medication to consider adding is carvedilol. I have tried to avoid this, given the potential for issues with erectile dysfunction. I counseled the patient about spironolactone side effects, including gynecomastia and electrolyte disturbances, as well as his increased risk of dehydration, with one sign to watch for being dizziness. If we are not able to improve his blood pressure with spironolactone, the next step would be sending him to the resistant hypertension clinic.\n\nI provided and reviewed with Mr. Roberts the American Heart association website (heart.org) and encouraged him to access for tips on lowering his salt intake and increasing his potassium intake. His maximum salt intake should be 1500 to <2000 mg per day. He was provided materials to follow the DASH diet and encouraged to meet 30-min of walking most days.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nSchedule follow up appointment in 2 weeks for blood pressure check and basic metabolic panel. Reduce sodium intake to 1500 to <2000 mg per day.

She reports recent episodes of abdominal cramping, sharp pains, and diarrhea, often triggered by spicy foods, fatty foods, alcohol, and large portion sizes. She has been consuming spicy shrimp and pasta (chicken alfredo) during social outings, with alcohol intake primarily involving tequila, dark liquor, and occasional martinis. She notes that her symptoms improve with dietary modifications but persist, especially after eating out or drinking. She has previously been treated with Bentyl and Reglan, with current use of medications as needed. She reports difficulty with regular fiber intake and has experienced some flare-ups despite dietary efforts.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM:\nThe patient is alert, cooperative, and appears her stated age. Vital signs are stable. Physical examination reveals a soft, non-tender abdomen with no masses or organomegaly. Bowel sounds are normal and active. Cardiac and lung examinations are unremarkable, with clear lungs and a regular heart rhythm.\n\nRESULTS:\nNo abnormal findings on physical exam. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, with normal bowel sounds. No laboratory or imaging results were discussed during this visit.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\nBrittany Edwards has IBS with functional abdominal pain, exacerbated by dietary and lifestyle factors such as spicy foods, fatty foods, alcohol, and stress. Management includes dietary and lifestyle modifications, including avoiding greasy and fatty foods, reducing alcohol intake, and portion control. Pharmacologic therapy involves prescribing Citrucel (fiber supplement) twice daily for regularity, Bentyl 20 mg as needed for cramping (with a refill authorized), and Zofran for nausea as needed. She is advised to recognize and avoid triggers, drink water instead of soda, and monitor symptoms. For persistent or frequent symptoms, initiation of a neuromodulator such as Elavil 25 mg nightly at bedtime is recommended to reduce gut hypersensitivity. She is instructed to follow up in one month via MyChart email to assess response, side effects, and any need for medication adjustments.",

pleasant , 32-year-old female who was last seen in august of 2019 with flares of abdominal pain , who was diagnosed with irritable bowl that was treated with bentyl .\n[doctor] she had a previous prescription for reglan that she received from the emergency room that she used as needed for nausea . she was instructed to start a low dose fiber supplement , such as citrucel , daily , probiotics to help with gas and bloating , bentyl up to four times daily for intestinal cramping , and stop reglan and use zofran as needed . neuromodulators such as elavil and buspar were discussed but not started .\n[doctor] hello , how are you ?\n[patient] i'm okay .\n[doctor] good . how have you been feeling ?\n[patient] not so good .\n[doctor] yeah , so my nurse told me you have been going out to eat some on friday nights and saturday nights and that you have had some spicy foods or spicy shrimp .\n[patient] yeah , i have .\n[doctor] okay . well , your gut probably does not always appreciate that .\n[patient] no , it does n't like it at all .\n[doctor] yeah , so ibs is one of those things where you are very sensitive to certain things such as spicy foods or fatty foods and alcohol . and this can cause lower belly stuff like cramps , or you can get upper belly stuff such as nausea .\n[patient] i've been getting both .\n[doctor] okay . um , so how frequently have you been getting or having a bowel movement on normal days ?\n[patient] i'm starting to notice it's between two and three times a day .\n[doctor] okay . and are they soft stools or formed stools ?\n[patient] um , they're formed .\n[doctor] okay . and after you have gone out either drinking with your friends , do you tend to have more diarrhea ?\n[patient] yeah , i do .\n[doctor] okay . do you feel it's the food or the alcohol or both ?\n[patient] uh , well usually we go to friday's restaurant . i always eat pasta , the chicken alfredo .\n[doctor] okay . i can s- i can bet it's the alfredo sauce .\n[patient] but it normally does n't bother me .\n[doctor] okay . well , pasta can make you bloated , uh , but it does n't usually cause diarrhea . grilled chi- uh , grilled chicken is usually all right . alfredo , though , is higher in fat , and it does contain dairy . but you're saying it usually does n't bother you ?\n[patient] no .\n[doctor] okay . what type of alcohol drink do you drink when you are there ? is it a sweet drink ?\n[patient] most of the time it's either tequila or dark liquor . i prefer patron , but if i get brown liquor , i only get two . um , every now and again , i'll drink a martini .\n[doctor] sometimes it's the mixer they tend to put in the drinks , but it can be a variety of things . um , so when you're not eating out or drinking , what we do on a daily basis does help keep us regular , so when it does flare up , it c- it might not be as bad . um , have you had any luck using the fiber like citrucel regularly ?\n[patient] um , no . i guess i need to find a new drink .\n[doctor] okay . and how is it during the week ?\n[patient] like what i eat ?\n[doctor] yeah , and with the diarrhea and abdomal- um , abdominal pain .\n[patient] right now , i'm still having the cramping and sharp pains , so i've been avoiding heavy foods . i did have some fried chicken today , though .\n[doctor] and was everything all right after that ?\n[patient] yeah , for the most part .\n[doctor] okay . remember , it's also the portion sizes . so i mean , if you eat a little and you feel fine , then that's okay . you have to just really watch the portions .\n[patient] okay , good . i ca n't go out- go without some fried chicken at least once in a while .\n[doctor] sounds good . all right , well let's take a look at you today , and we'll do a brief physical exam . you will hear me call out some findings . i will answer any questions , and we will discuss once we have finished the exam .\n[patient] sounds good .\n[doctor] all right . so the patient is alert and cooperative , appears stated age . all right . i'm going to listen to your heart and lungs . and lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally . heart regular rate and rhythm . all right , so if you could just lay back for me , and i'll examine your abdomen .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] all right . do you have any tenderness ?\n[patient] no , not really .\n[doctor] okay . so the abdomen is soft , non-tender . no masses or organomegaly . and let me take a listen . normal active bowel sounds . all right . you can go ahead and sit up now . thank you .\n[doctor] all right , so first i want you to try citrucel . it does come in a tablet . you should use it twice daily for regularity . then i would say , if you know you're going out and will possibly have diarrhea as a result , you can go ahead and use your bentyl 20 milligrams . you can do one tablet before you eat , and then repeat up to four times daily . and then on days when you feel good , you do n't have to use anything . um , and then on friday before you leave the house , you can take a bentyl and put one in your pocket for later , and then you can repeat the same thing on saturday if you want , and that will be totally fine .\n[patient] okay , that sounds good .\n[doctor] okay . and so your bentyl , that's the anti-spasm medication , and i would take the higher dose .\n[patient] can i get a refill of that ?\n[doctor] yes , absolutely . uh , so take one tablet about 30 to 45 minutes before leaving the house and then the second tablet at the restaurant . then with the nausea , um , i think we should try and see if you can recognize a pattern with what you are eating and drinking , um , um , about , like , what makes it worse .\n[patient] yeah , i noticed i've been doing better with drinking water instead of sodas .\n[doctor] okay , good . and then for your zofran , i would n't take that ahead of time . just plan on drinking plenty of water .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] okay , and you can take it , but before you do , we want to try to reduce the triggers . uh , so watch out for greasy or fatty foods and sugary drinks .\n[patient] okay , i can do that .\n[doctor] okay . and so , however , if it is not just these isolated inci- incidents and the symptoms are happening all the time , we could put you on a long term medication that would take ... that you would take every night . and so then you do n't have to use so much bentyl or the zofran . how do you feel about that ?\n[patient] i was actually going to ask you about something like that to help avoid flares altogether .\n[doctor] yeah , there is . and it actually works on the chemicals in your brain that are causing your gut to be overly sensitive . one is called elavil , but the only drawback is that it can make you a little sleepy . how does that sound ?\n[patient] that sounds like a much better plan .\n[doctor] okay , great . we can definitely do that . uh , just take it every night before bedtime .\n[patient] okay , that sounds good . thank you so much .\n[doctor] you're welcome . and so i have gone ahead and sent your prescriptions to your pharmacy . just give us a call if you have any questions or need us for anything else . and then let's plan on touching base through mychart email in about a month to just check in to see how you're doing with symptoms . okay ?\n[patient] okay , that sounds good . thank you .\n[doctor] you're welcome , and have a good rest of your day .\n[doctor] so review of symptoms is positive for diarrhea , nausea , and abdominal pain . assessment and plan . brittany edwards is a pleasant female with ibs and functional abdominal pain , aggravated by high stress , poor eating habits , and poor sleeping habits . i've encouraged dietary and lifestyle modifications , as well as starting a neuromodulator such as elavil 25 milligrams at bedtime for ibs .\n[doctor] she can use bentyl 20 milligrams as needed 30 to 45 minutes prior to eating out at a restaurant . she can also use zofran if needed . however , i have encouraged her to reduce greasy and fatty foods and alcohol consumption . i have asked her to follow up in one month by emailing over mychart regarding any side effects and issues , or issues with elavil or if adjustments are needed .\n</conversation>\nThe generated note will be provided in these tags:\n<response>\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:\nBrittany Edwards, a 32-year-old female, presents for a return visit regarding her irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) with associated functional abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. She reports recent episodes of abdominal cramping, sharp pains, and diarrhea, often triggered by spicy foods, fatty foods, alcohol, and large portion sizes. She has been consuming spicy shrimp and pasta (chicken alfredo) during social outings, with alcohol intake primarily involving tequila, dark liquor, and occasional martinis. She notes that her symptoms improve with dietary modifications but persist, especially after eating out or drinking. She has previously been treated with Bentyl and Reglan, with current use of medications as needed. She reports difficulty with regular fiber intake and has experienced some flare-ups despite dietary efforts.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM:\nThe patient is alert, cooperative, and appears her stated age. Vital signs are stable. Physical examination reveals a soft, non-tender abdomen with no masses or organomegaly. Bowel sounds are normal and active. Cardiac and lung examinations are unremarkable, with clear lungs and a regular heart rhythm.\n\nRESULTS:\nNo abnormal findings on physical exam. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, with normal bowel sounds. No laboratory or imaging results were discussed during this visit.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\nBrittany Edwards has IBS with functional abdominal pain, exacerbated by dietary and lifestyle factors such as spicy foods, fatty foods, alcohol, and stress. Management includes dietary and lifestyle modifications, including avoiding greasy and fatty foods, reducing alcohol intake, and portion control. Pharmacologic therapy involves prescribing Citrucel (fiber supplement) twice daily for regularity, Bentyl 20 mg as needed for cramping (with a refill authorized), and Zofran for nausea as needed. She is advised to recognize and avoid triggers, drink water instead of soda, and monitor symptoms. For persistent or frequent symptoms, initiation of a neuromodulator such as Elavil 25 mg nightly at bedtime is recommended to reduce gut hypersensitivity. She is instructed to follow up in one month via MyChart email to assess response, side effects, and any need for medication adjustments.\n</response>\nThe reference note will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nCHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nFollow up irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nMs. Brittany Edwards is a pleasant 32-year-old female who returns in follow up for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) with functional abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.\n\nMs. Edwards was last seen in August 2019 with flares of abdominal pain and was diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome that was treated with Bentyl. She had a previous prescription for Reglan that she received from the emergency room that she used as needed for nausea. She was instructed to start a low dose fiber supplement such as Citrucel daily, probiotics to help with gas and bloating, and Bentyl up to 4 times daily for intestinal cramping. She was instructed to discontinue Reglan and to use Zofran as needed for nausea. Neuromodulators such as Elavil and Buspar were discussed but not started.\n\nMs. Edwards continues to have intermittent abdominal symptoms. Monday through Thursday she has less flare ups of her symptoms but states she is currently having cramps and sharp pains. She describes she recently ate shrimp which caused her to have both upper and lower abdominal pain and bloating. However, she notices episodes of diarrhea after eating chicken alfredo and consuming alcohol. She does not believe the alfredo contributes to her symptoms. The patient states she consumes 2 drinks when out of either tequila or brown liquor and occasionally a martini. She does her best to avoid \u201cheavy foods,\u201d but ate fried chicken today without any symptoms. She has stopped drinking sodas which has been helpful.\u202fThe patient reports passing 2-3 formed stools a day.\n\nREVIEW OF SYMPTOMS\n\n\u2022\u202fGastrointestinal:\u202fPositive nausea, diarrhea, and abdominal pain.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nAlert and cooperative, appears stated age.\n\nRespiratory\nLungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.\n\nCardiovascular\nHeart regular rate and rhythm.\n\nGastrointestinal\nAbdomen soft, non-tender, no masses or organomegaly. Normoactive bowel sounds.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\n\u2022 Irritable bowel syndrome\n\nBrittany Edwards is a 32-year-old established patient who returned today to discuss management of IBS and functional abdominal pain made worse by high stress, poor eating habits, and poor sleeping habits.\n\nPLAN\n\nI have encouraged dietary and lifestyle modifications as well as starting a neuromodulator, such as Elavil 25 mg at bedtime for IBS. She can use\u202fBentyl\u202f20 mg as needed 30-45 minutes\u202fbefore eating out at a restaurant. She can also use Zofran as needed for nausea. However, I have encouraged her to reduce greasy fatty foods and alcohol consumption.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nSend MyChart message in 1 month regarding any side effects of issues with Elavil or if dose adjustments are needed.\nReturn to clinic in 1 month or sooner if needed.\n</gold_response>\nCarefully review the <response> based on the <conversation> and compare it to the <gold_response> when needed.\n\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Does the note provide correct clinical information based on the conversation?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the note include all important medical details from the conversation?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the note written clearly and organized in a standard clinical format for clinicians\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

    "predicted_text": "**HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:**  \nMr. Christopher Watson is an 86-year-old male presenting for follow-up after shunt surgery for adult hydrocephalus performed on August 1, 2020. He initially presented with a 8-10 year history of progressive gait impairment, cognitive decline, and urinary incontinence. Since surgery, he reports improvement in gait, now able to walk to the dining room, and some improvement in bladder control, though he continues to wear diapers. He feels cognitively better, able to have normal conversations, and denies headaches, shunt-related pain, or abdominal discomfort. No recent hospitalizations or infections are reported.\n\n**PHYSICAL EXAM:**  \nVital signs are stable: BP 124/80 mmHg, HR 64 bpm, RR 18, weight 174 lbs, pain score 0/10. The shunt site is clean, dry, and intact. Neurological exam shows pupils equal, extraocular movements intact, facial symmetry, normal motor strength and bulk, and no dysarthria. Coordination is slightly slow but otherwise normal. Gait assessment with the Tinetti test shows slight improvement (score 18-20/28). Cognitive testing reveals mild improvement: MMSE score of 26/30 with some recall ability, up from previous scores. Cranial nerves are intact, and no signs of recent falls, hallucinations, or mood disturbances.\n\n**RESULTS:**  \nRecent CT scan from October 15, 2020, shows a tiny amount of blood fluid collection in the right parietal region and a small subdural collection, not associated with symptoms. The scan also indicates small vessel ischemic changes. The shunt setting remains at 2.0, with no evidence of increased intracranial pressure or significant abnormalities. MMSE and gait scores have improved slightly since prior assessments.\n\n**ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:**  \nMr. Watson demonstrates clinical improvement post-shunt surgery in gait, cognition, and continence. The small fluid collection observed on imaging is not causing symptoms; therefore, the plan is to monitor and leave the shunt setting unchanged for 2-3 months before considering any adjustments. He is advised to return in three months for follow-up. Regarding driving, it is unlikely he will pass safety evaluations at this time, but improvement over 9-12 months is possible, and he may consider enrolling in a driver safety program. No current signs of shunt malfunction or infection. Continued observation of neurological status and imaging is recommended. The patient and his daughter are counseled on safety and follow-up plans.",

follow-up for adult hydrocephalus . this is his first visit since undergoing sh- shunt surgery , excuse me , on august 1st , 2020 .\n[doctor] i have followed mr . watson since may of 2020 when he first presented with eight to ten years of progressive gait impairment , cognitive impairment , and decreased bladder control . we established a diagnosis of adult hydrocephalus with a spino catheter protocol in june 2020 , and he underwent shunt surgery on august 1st , 2020 . a medtronic strata programmable shunt in the ventricular peritoneal configuration was programmed at a level 2.0 was placed .\n[doctor] good morning , mr . watson , who is the nice lady you have with you today ?\n[patient] hi , doc . this is my daughter , theresa . she is the one who helps me keep things straight .\n[doctor] mr . watson , have you been sick or been hosp -- hospitalized since your shu- shunt surgery three months ago .\n[patient] uh , not that i recall .\n[patient_guest] no , he has n't . he has been doing much better .\n[doctor] good , i'm glad to hear that .\n[doctor] before surgery , you were having some progressive problems that affected your walking , thinking , and bladder control . are these symptoms better , worse , or unchanged ?\n[patient_guest] his walking has improved . he's now able to walk to the dining room just fine . but he could not do that before surgery . he still has times where i have to help him .\n[doctor] that's impressive , mr . watson .\n[patient] yeah , i guess .\n[patient_guest] now his bladder control did improve some after surgery , but now seems to have leveled out . so he is wearing diapers .\n[doctor] no issues with sores from wearing the diaper ? and any decreased or painful urination ?\n[patient_guest] no , not at all .\n[doctor] and how about cognition ?\n[patient] i think i'm better . i do n't feel lost when talking to someone anymore .\n[patient_guest] dad and i both think my sister , hannah , summarized it best . she said \" i feel like i can have a normal conversation with him again , \"\n[doctor] that's so wonderful ! now have you had any headaches or pain where the shunt is ?\n[patient] no . has n't bothered me one bit .\n[doctor] okay . and any pain in your belly at all ?\n[patient] ca n't say that i have .\n[doctor] okay , sounds like you have been improving . alrighty , mr . watson , i'm going to step out of the room while my resident comes in to do a few tests for me . is that all right ?\n[patient] sounds good .\n[doctor] okay , i'm going to go out and review the ct scan you had last month , and then we'll chat about it when i come in .\n[doctor] all righty , mr . watson , so you definitely have made some improvements since the shunt surgery . now on ct scan though i do believe i see a tiny bit of blood fluid collection in the right parietal region . now , i do n't believe that that's causing any symptoms , and i , it actually was n't documented by the radiologist when he read the ct scan .\n[patient] so what does that mean ?\n[doctor] just that i would like to leave the shunt set for another two to three months before we go in changing it . like i said , if you're not having any headaches or pain and you have improved so that's all good for me . so really there's , there's nothing to worry about .\n[patient] all right so i'll come back in three months ?\n[doctor] yep , that's right .\n[patient] i do have a question for you though .\n[doctor] yeah , of course .\n[patient] do you think i will be able to drive again ?\n[doctor] ah man , mr . watson , i knew you were gon na ask me that one . i think at this point it's unlikely that your movement speed will improve to the level that would be needed for you to pass the driver safety evaluation . now , i will say that i do occasionally have patients who surprise me by improving over a nine to 12 month range . and that , that definitely could be you . you could definitely pass it at that point . so if you improve and we can continue to talk about that then , ya know , i think it could be possible , um , and i'd be happy to recommend it .\n[doctor] now , you could definitely also enroll in a driver safety program without my recommendation . so you could kind of do that preemptively , and then we could continue to watch for your improvement as we go .\n[patient] okay . i kinda figured that anyway but i just thought i'd ask . i do n't like to burden anyone when i just need to run to the store but i also know that i need to be safe .\n[doctor] yeah , your safety is our number one priority and , ya know , i'm sure your daughters do n't mind as much , right , they want to keep you here and have you safe . but , i overall am very pleased with how much you have improved . and so , i'm sure when we talk again in three months , we'll continue to be on that upward trajectory or improvement .\n[patient] i sure hope so , doc .\n[patient_guest] we really appreciate all that you've done . do we make the appointment out front ?\n[doctor] yeah , that would be great . the girls up front will take care of you and get you settled for three months from now , and you both take care , all right ?\n[patient]

This is his first visit since undergoing shunt surgery 08/01/2020. He is accompanied by his daughter, Theresa, together they give his history.\n\nI have followed Mr. Watson since May 2020. He presented with 8-10 years of progressive gait impairment, cognitive impairment, and decreased bladder control. We established a diagnosis of adult hydrocephalus with the spinal catheter protocol in June 2020 and he underwent shunt surgery on 08/01/2020. A Medtronic Strata programmable shunt in the ventriculoperitoneal configuration programmed at level 2.0 was placed.\n\nMr. Watson has had no hospitalizations or other illnesses since I last saw him. With respect to his walking, his daughter states that he is now able to walk to the dining room just fine but could not before his surgery. His balance has improved though he still has some walking impairment. With respect to his bladder control, initially there was some improvement, but he has leveled off and he wears a diaper. With respect to his cognition, both Theresa and the patient say that his thinking has improved. The other daughter, Hannah summarized it best according to the two of them, she said \u201cI feel like I can have a normal conversation with him again.\u201d Mr. Watson has had no headaches and no pain at the shunt site or in the abdomen.\n\nPAST HISTORY\n\nUrinary incontinence.\nAdult hydrocephalus.\nGait impairment.\nCognitive impairment.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\n\u2022 Constitutional Symptoms: Significant for impaired ability to carry out daily functions. Negative for fever or unintentional weight loss.\n\u2022 Genitourinary: Significant for urinary incontinence and wearing a diaper. Negative for genital sores, decreased or painful output.\n\u2022 Neurological: Significant for continued walking impairment and cognitive impairment. Negative for headaches, recent falls, or hallucinations.\n\u2022 Psychiatric: Negative for depression, excessive worrying, or mood swings.\n\nVITALS\n\nBlood pressure 124/80, heart rate is 64, respiratory rate is 18, weight 174 pounds, and pain is 0/10.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nConstitutional\nMr. Watson is a pleasant and cooperative man who is able to converse easily though his daughter adds some details.\n\nHead and Face\nThe shunt site was clean, dry, and intact and confirmed at a setting of 2.0.\n\nNeurological\nMental status: Tested for recent and remote memory, attention span, concentration, and fund of knowledge. He scored 26/30 on the MMSE when tested with spelling and 25/30 when tested with calculations. Of note, he was able to get two of the three memory words with cuing and the third one with multiple choice. This was a slight improvement over his initial score of 23/30 with calculations and 24/30 with spelling and at that time he was unable to remember any memory words with cuing and only one with multiple choice.\nGait: Tested using the Tinetti assessment tool. He was tested without an assistive device and received a gait score of 6-8/12 and a balance of score of 12/16 for a total score of 18-20/28. This has slightly improved from his initial score of 15-17/28.\nCranial Nerves: Pupils are equal. Extraocular movements are intact. Face symmetric. No dysarthria.\nMotor: Normal for bulk and strength.\nCoordination: Slow for finger-to-nose.\n\nRESULTS\n\nCT scan of the head from 10/15/2020: It shows a frontal horn span at the level of foramen of Munro of 4.6 cm with a 3rd ventricular contour that is flat with the span of 10 mm. By my reading, there is a tiny amount of blood in the right frontal region with just a tiny subdural collection. This was not noticed by the radiologist who stated no extra axial fluid collections. There is also substantial small vessel ischemic change.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\n\u2022 Adult hydrocephalus.\n\u2022 Gait impairment.\n\u2022 Urinary incontinence and urgency.\n\u2022 Cognitive impairment.\n\nMr. Watson has made some improvement with his hydrocephalus since shunt surgery. There is a tiny fluid collection in the right parietal region. I do not believe that this tiny amount of fluid is symptomatic, and it was not documented by the radiologist when he read the CT scan.\n\nMr. Watson asked me about whether he will be able to drive again. Unfortunately, I think it is unlikely that his speed of movement will improve to a level that he will be able to pass a driver's safety evaluation, however, occasionally patients surprise me by improving enough over 9 to 12 months that they are able to pass such a test. I would certainly be happy to recommend such a test if I believe he is likely to pass it and he is always welcome to enroll in a driver's safety program without my recommendation, however, I think it is exceeding unlikely that he has the capability of passing this rigorous test at this time. I also think it is quite likely he will not regain sufficient speed of motion to pass such a test.\n\nPLAN\n\nI had a long discussion with the patient and his daughter. We are all pleased that he has started to make some improvement with his hydrocephalus because of the fluid collection in the right parietal region, I would like to leave the setting at 2.0 for another three months before we consider changing the shunt.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nFollow up in 3 months.\n</gold_response>\nCarefully review the <response> based on the <conversation> and compare it to the <gold_response> when needed.\n\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Does the note provide correct clinical information based on the conversation?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the note include all important medical details from the conversation?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the note written clearly and organized in a standard clinical format for clinicians\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

She was counseled on potential side effects, including nausea, headache, dizziness, and sleep disturbances. Continuation of current antihypertensive medications is advised, with emphasis on consistent use. Blood pressure monitoring should continue at home. Additional recommendations include updating influenza and Shingrix vaccinations (which she deferred). The importance of alcohol cessation for blood pressure control and overall health was reinforced.

these tags:\n<conversation>\nDoctor-patient dialogue:\n\n[doctor] amanda taylor , birth date october 31st 1949 . patient is a 72 year old woman who comes for followup for hypertension . her history includes significant alcohol use disorder and mi- mild hypercholesterolemia . at last visit on april 16th her blood pressure was 130 over 90 . after presenting at 150 over 100 she was prescribed hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 milligrams by mouth once daily , and lisinopril 20 milligrams by mouth once daily . cmp and cbc were essentially unremarkable .\n[doctor] hi miss taylor , how are you today ?\n[patient] hi , i'm- i'm good , thank you .\n[doctor] thanks for coming in today .\n[patient] yeah , no problem .\n[doctor] so how have things been going for you ?\n[patient] uh , they've been all right . i'm struggling with not drinking . i wanted to discuss that , uh , shot that you had mentioned last time , but we did n't get to discuss it too much .\n[doctor] okay , well i'll be happy to provide you with more information . so tell me when did you last have a drink ?\n[patient] on monday .\n[doctor] okay , so you've gone a couple days without it ?\n[patient] yeah , yeah i have .\n[doctor] yeah , and had you been drinking for a while ?\n[patient] yep .\n[doctor] how much had- how much had you been drinking ?\n[patient] um , four or five times a week hard alcohol , so , you know .\n[doctor] okay . well it will certainly help your blood pressure if you're able to stop drinking .\n[patient] yeah , yeah i- i- i agree with you .\n[doctor] okay . are you taking your blood pressure medications ?\n[patient] yeah , but i'm only taking half of the lisinopril .\n[doctor] okay .\n[patient] i- b- well , the first time i took it i felt lethargic and tired , so i only took a half dose the next time . i felt much better and i did n't have the headaches or the swooshing that started in my left ear . so i feel like it's definitely helping but i do n't know ... i know it's not gon na be okay until i stop drinking .\n[doctor] and are you also taking the full dose of the hydrochlorothiazide ? do you have any , um , chest tightness or pressure or any shortness of breath ?\n[patient] yeah i'm taking the full dose of that medicine too , and no none of those symptoms .\n[doctor] okay . anything else i should be aware of or that we should be checking ?\n[patient] mm , no .\n[doctor] okay , good . are you doing the blood pressure checks at home ?\n[patient] yes . yes i am .\n[doctor] okay good . what kind of numbers are you seeing ?\n[patient] well , in the morning i'm seeing lower numbers than in the evening , um , where i run anywhere from like 130 to 145 or 150 over 95 to 100 on the bottom .\n[doctor] okay .\n[patient] but in the evenings if i sit there for a while and then take it , it goes down . kind of like when i come here it's always high but then it goes down . in the mornings it's generally more normal where it's supposed to be .\n[doctor] uh- .\n[patient] mm , also i'm taking my medicine in the morning when i get up instead of in the evening .\n[doctor] yeah , so it sounds like we are not too far out of where we wan na be .\n[patient] right , mm-hmm .\n[doctor] okay . well let me get a listen to your heart , go ahead and hop up here .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] use my general exam template . all right , go ahead and take some deep breaths . okay , good . any fever , cough , shortness of breath or sore throat ?\n[patient] no .\n[doctor] any recent travel or contact or exposure to the coronavirus ?\n[patient] nope .\n[doctor] have you received your coronavirus vaccine ?\n[patient] yes , on february 9th .\n[doctor] okay , great . all right well i'm just going to look at your ankles and feet , i'm looking for any signs of swelling .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] all right , well everything looks good . you can go ahead and sit up miss taylor . all right , so the good news is everything is looking okay . i think we both agree if you were able to stop drinking your blood pressure would cease to be an issue for you .\n[patient] yeah i agree with that .\n[doctor] so let us discuss the potential medicine to help you with that . what it does is it blocks some of the brain receptors that alcohol stimulates and it tricks the brain into thinking it does not need alcohol , thereby cutting down the urges .\n[patient] the urge to drink or the constant thinking about it ?\n[doctor] it actually will help with both .\n[patient] okay . so is it like a one-time thing ?\n[doctor] generally the shot is given about once a month , it can also be given as a daily pill , but the shot does tend to work a bit better .\n[patient] yeah i've taken things like this in the past and if it is a pill , i know i wo n't take it . with a shot , it's not like you can un-take it .\n[doctor] yeah that's true . and the shot has been shown to work , it is more just a matter of getting you in to get your shot a month later with the nurse .\n[patient] yeah , sure , sure .\n[doctor] okay , so it's called naltrexone . i think the other name might be vivitrol . like i've said , the research on it is pretty good .\n[patient] i think i may have taken the naltrexone before .\n[doctor] okay , yeah , maybe you have .\n[patient] yeah , if it was available in a pill form then i'm almost certain i've tried it b- before .\n[doctor] okay . if this sounds good though , we can go ahead get you started with the shot . i am looking and it looks like we have you coming back in on may 17th for your first shot , does that sound good ?\n[patient] yeah , yeah , that sounds great . are there any possible side effects ?\n[doctor] yeah , some people will experience some nausea , headache , dizziness , anxi- anxiety , tiredness and trouble sleeping , but generally the side effects are mild and should go away within a few days .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] then we can schedule you for a follow-up in june to see how you are doing .\n[patient] all right that sounds good .\n[doctor] all right great . well otherwise stay with your current medicines , keep checking your blood pressure , and let's see if we can stop the alcohol for good . let us know if you have any questions or any issues come up after you receive the first dose .\n[patient] all right , sounds good , thank you .\n[doctor] you are welcome , have a good rest of your day .\n[patient] you too .\n[doctor] miss taylor is drinking alcohol four to five days per week to excess . no tobacco , no substance abuse , skin is moist , good trigger . on exam she is alert ,

She reports experiencing abnormal vaginal discharge with a different color, consistency, and odor starting last week. She also reports pain on the right side of her vagina that has persisted. She denies fever or chills. She notes that she and her partner have been together for three years, with suspicions of infidelity beginning approximately three months ago. She has a history of an abnormal Pap smear at age 20, with her last Pap smear six months ago, which was normal. She is concerned about potential STD exposure and wants to be evaluated.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM:\nPelvic examination revealed no external lesions. The labia majora and minora appeared normal. The vaginal discharge was physiological in appearance, with normal color and smell. The cervix was normal without lesions, and the vaginal walls appeared healthy. No cervical motion tenderness, adnexal tenderness, or masses were noted. No abnormalities were observed on visual inspection.\n\nRESULTS:\nSwabs were obtained for gonorrhea, chlamydia, and trichomoniasis testing. Blood samples were collected for syphilis, HIV, and hepatitis C screening. Results are pending; the patient will be contacted if any abnormalities are found. She was advised to call in three days for results if she does not hear from the clinic.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\nMs. Ross is being screened for STDs due to her recent symptoms, partner infidelity, and history of abnormal Pap smear. She is considered high risk. The plan includes STD testing as outlined, with follow-up to review results. She was advised to return for her next annual checkup if all tests are normal. Education on safe sexual practices and the importance of regular screening was provided.",

She reports experiencing abnormal vaginal discharge with a different color, consistency, and odor starting last week. She also reports pain on the right side of her vagina that has persisted. She denies fever or chills. She notes that she and her partner have been together for three years, with suspicions of infidelity beginning approximately three months ago. She has a history of an abnormal Pap smear at age 20, with her last Pap smear six months ago, which was normal. She is concerned about potential STD exposure and wants to be evaluated.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM:\nPelvic examination revealed no external lesions. The labia majora and minora appeared normal. The vaginal discharge was physiological in appearance, with normal color and smell. The cervix was normal without lesions, and the vaginal walls appeared healthy. No cervical motion tenderness, adnexal tenderness, or masses were noted. No abnormalities were observed on visual inspection.\n\nRESULTS:\nSwabs were obtained for gonorrhea, chlamydia, and trichomoniasis testing. Blood samples were collected for syphilis, HIV, and hepatitis C screening. Results are pending; the patient will be contacted if any abnormalities are found. She was advised to call in three days for results if she does not hear from the clinic.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\nMs. Ross is being screened for STDs due to her recent symptoms, partner infidelity, and history of abnormal Pap smear. She is considered high risk. The plan includes STD testing as outlined, with follow-up to review results. She was advised to return for her next annual checkup if all tests are normal. Education on safe sexual practices and the importance of regular screening was provided.\n</response>\nThe reference note will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nCHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nFull-spectrum sexually transmitted disease testing.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nMs. Ross is a 23-year-old female who presents today as a new patient for full-spectrum STD testing.\n\nThe patient states that she is having symptoms of discomfort, a change in discharge, and an odor in her vaginal region. She says that the right side of her vagina is starting to become painful but denies any fever or chills. She states that she recently learned her partner of 3 years has been engaging in sexual encounters with other people for quite some time, and she wants to be evaluated for all sexually transmitted diseases.\n\nMs. Ross reports noticing a change in the odor, color, and consistency of her vaginal discharge last week. She notes that this did not alarm her until the right side of her vagina became painful and sore, which has not subsided. She states that she had an abnormal Pap Smear around the age of 20, but all her Pap Smears since then, including her most recent one approximately 6 months ago, have all been normal.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nGenitourinary\nPelvic exam: No external lesions, normal labia majora and labia minora. Normal physiological discharge with normal color and odor. Cervix is normal, vaginal wall is normal, no cervical motion tenderness or masses noted. Swabs were obtained for sexual transmitted disease testing.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\n\u2022 Screening for sexually transmitted disease.\n\nPLAN\n\nMs. Ross is a 23-year-old female who presents today as a new patient for full-spectrum STD testing. We will screen her today for gonorrhea, chlamydia, trichomoniasis, syphilis, HIV, and hepatitis C. Patient is high risk due to an abnormal pap smear in the past and the recent discovery of her sexual partner having multiple partners for some period of time. We will call the patient with the results of the laboratory testing.\n</gold_response>\nCarefully review the <response> based on the <conversation> and compare it to the <gold_response> when needed.\n\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Does the note provide correct clinical information based on the conversation?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the note include all important medical details from the conversation?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the note written clearly and organized in a standard clinical format for clinicians\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

    "predicted_text": "**HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:**  \nMr. Tyler Nelson, a 74-year-old male with a history of rheumatoid arthritis, presents with persistent swelling and pain in his right knee, which was previously treated with a steroid injection. The swelling initially improved but recurred approximately two months ago, now involving the entire leg. He reports swelling has not responded fully to compression socks, and he experiences significant stiffness, especially when rising from sitting, requiring the use of a cane. His pain level varies, typically around 6 on a normal day, currently about 3. but with episodes of increased discomfort. He notes the swelling has been ongoing for about two months and has gradually worsened. He is on Xeljanz (11 mg daily) and Celebrex (200 mg daily), both of which he reports are effective until the recent swelling. He denies recent trauma but reports increased difficulty with mobility and stiffness.\n\n**PHYSICAL EXAM:**  \nVital signs not provided. Examination of the right knee reveals slight decreased range of motion with pain on full extension. There is noticeable swelling with pitting edema around the knee and ankle. The knee is warm to touch, indicating inflammation. Capillary refill in the toes is normal. The area around the knee is tender, described as sore like an old bruise. No signs of skin discoloration or open wounds. The leg shows significant edema extending beyond the knee, with some discomfort on palpation.\n\n**RESULTS:**  \nAn initial aspiration of the right knee yielded 3 mL of clear fluid, which was blood-tinged. No recent imaging results are available at this time; an X-ray of the knee is planned to evaluate the cause of swelling and joint status. Laboratory results include current CMP levels, which are within normal limits. No recent blood work results are provided, but routine monitoring of Xeljanz levels is recommended.\n\n**ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:**  \nMr. Nelson has active right knee inflammation likely related to rheumatoid arthritis, with persistent swelling and pain unresponsive to previous treatments. The plan includes:\n- Performing a steroid injection into the right knee after aspirating fluid, with 80 mg of triamcinolone and lidocaine, which was tolerated well.\n- Obtaining an X-ray of the right knee to assess joint status and rule out other causes of swelling.\n- Initiating physical therapy to improve mobility and reduce stiffness.\n- Reinforcing leg edema management with continued use of compression socks, elevating legs, and reducing salt intake.\n- Advising to follow up with his primary care provider for ongoing management and routine blood work, including monitoring of Xeljanz levels.\n- Considering further intervention, including possible surgical consultation if symptoms persist or worsen.\n- Patient education on risks and benefits of procedures, with verbal consent obtained for the steroid injection.\n\nFollow-up is scheduled with his PCP, and the patient was advised to report any worsening symptoms or new concerns.",

He was last seen by me on 03/04/2021, where he received a steroid injection to his right knee. He continues to experience right knee pain and swelling. The pain level is 6/10. He notes when he stands after he has been sitting for a while, he has to use a cane to \"get his bearings.\" The injection he received to the right knee at the last visit was only beneficial for a few weeks. The patient notes whole right leg swelling since the last visit. He usually wears support hose, which helps to some degree. He has not attended physical therapy.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nMusculoskeletal\nLower right extremity: Swollen right knee, slightly reduced range of motion. Skin warm to touch. Lower right leg pits with pressure.\n\nPROCEDURE\n\nFluid aspiration and Steroid injection.\nRisks, benefits, and alternatives were explained. The risks of steroid injection were explained, including but not limited to, hypopigmentation, soft tissue atrophy, tendon ruptures, and transient hyperglycemia among others. Verbal consent was obtained. The right knee was accessed through the lateral approach with 3 mL of initially clear fluid then blood-tinged fluid. Then the right knee was prepped in a standard fashion. The right knee was injected with 80 mg triamcinolone and 1 mL lidocaine. The procedure was tolerated well with no complications. Post procedure instructions were given.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\n\u2022 Rheumatoid arthritis management.\n\u2022 High risk medication use.\n\u2022 Right knee pain.\n\u2022 Lower extremity pitting edema.\n\nPLAN\n\nRheumatoid arthritis management.\nThe patient will continue Xeljanz XR 11 mg daily. He will also continue Celebrex 200 mg daily.\n\nHigh-risk medication use.\nThe patient is currently on the high-risk medication Xeljanz. We will check his CMP levels and monitor periodically every couple of months.\n\nRight knee pain.\nHe has right knee pain and swelling, with pain level 6/10. On exam today, the right knee continues to be hot, which is ongoing inflammation. We performed a fluid aspiration of the right knee today, see procedure note above. A steroid injection to the right knee was given today, see procedure note above. We will arrange for x-ray of the right knee and refer his to physical therapy.\n\nLower extremity pitting edema.\nThe patient notes whole right leg swelling since the last visit. He usually wears support hose, which helps to some degree. He has not seen his PCP. We discussed compression stockings, elevate feet, and a low salt diet. He will check with his PCP for further instructions.\n</gold_response>\nCarefully review the <response> based on the <conversation> and compare it to the <gold_response> when needed.\n\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Does the note provide correct clinical information based on the conversation?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the note include all important medical details from the conversation?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the note written clearly and organized in a standard clinical format for clinicians\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

these tags:\n<conversation>\nDoctor-patient dialogue:\n\n[doctor] uh , mrn49282721 . patient's name is jacqueline miller . use last visit exam where appropriate .\n[doctor] hi , how are you doing , jacqueline ?\n[patient] i'm pretty . good . how are you ?\n[doctor] good as well . so it sounds like we're , um , under good control right now .\n[patient] yes . it's doing much better .\n[doctor] good , good . do you have any rash leftover ?\n[patient] yeah , i have a- a small bit leftover . i started using , uh , doxycycline only one a day because i think the pharmacist said if it's getting better , to just limit it to once a day .\n[doctor] okay , that sounds good .\n[patient] but i was taking it twice a day and i did notice a lotta improvement .\n[doctor] okay .\n[patient] and then when i started doing it only once a day , it seems the same and it's not continuing to get better . so it's kinda plateaued a little bit .\n[doctor] i see . um , are you breastfeeding at this time ?\n[patient] no , i'm not right now .\n[doctor] okay , good . so you- you should not be breastfeeding while you're on that medication .\n[patient] yeah , actually i stopped breastfeeding and then asked for the doxycycline at that time .\n[doctor] okay . even with the doxycycline , you can keep using the elidel .\n[patient] okay . and i did n't take the elidel because when i read about it i got worried . so i wanted to just try the doxycycline and see .\n[doctor] okay . so we can talk about the elidel . a lot of the things you read about is not actually relevant to the cream or ointment form , but it's about the oral form that's used in really high doses , longterm , after people have a heart transplant or a kidney transplant or something like that .\n[patient] okay . i did n't realize that .\n[doctor] yeah , and when you suppress the immune system that hard for that long , it can predispose you for developing cancers like hematologic type cancers . it does n't apply to as-needed use of the medicine , a cream or an ointment , okay ?\n[patient] okay . then i can resume taking - taking the doxycycline twice a day again ?\n[doctor] so let me clarify . what exactly are you using ? and then we'll look at you and figure out , okay ? so you're using the sulfacetamide wash ? uh , how frequently are you using that one ?\n[patient] twice a day .\n[doctor] okay , and that's not drying you out too much ?\n[patient] no , that's fine .\n[doctor] okay . and you're using the metro cream ?\n[patient] yes .\n[doctor] how often are you using that one ?\n[patient] after my face wash , i immediately apply the cream .\n[doctor] okay . and then , are you using any other kind of lotions or anything ?\n[patient] no .\n[doctor] so you're not using the cetaphil cleanser ?\n[patient] i'm not .\n[doctor] okay . and no neutrogena wipes ?\n[patient] no wipes .\n[doctor] okay . um , and then what about , um , any lotions that you're using ?\n[patient] i'm not using any lotion right now , just those two .\n[doctor] no lotion , okay . so that may be something else we should add in , a lotion to just help moisturize . but we'll see .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] um , and then again , when did you go down to just taking the doxycycline once a day ?\n[patient] that was last week . so the first two weeks , i did twice a day .\n[doctor] okay .\n[patient] and then i started seeing improvement , and then i changed to just once a day .\n[doctor] okay . let me take a look at your face here . i'm gon na describe for the transcriptionist what i'm seeing . you're fitzpatrick skin type iv , meaning you're not going to burn , you're going to sun tan , um , essentially , iv to v. and then on bilateral medial cheeks , there are a few really faint erythematous papules and just maybe a little bit of redness around and underneath your nostrils . so you're right , it's not totally gone .\n[patient] yeah .\n[doctor] i think i would go ahead and go back to twice a day , every day , with the doxycycline .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] uh , but i would pickup the elidel too .\n[patient] okay , i can do that .\n[doctor] i mean , out of known risks associated with medications , topicals are usually safer and preferable to oral medications . with that being said , doxycycline is low risk .\n[patient] it is ? okay .\n[doctor] um , and doxycycline can give you bad upset stomach or heartburn . um , it will make you sunburn , even if you never sunburn , so you have to protect yourself .\n[patient] yeah , i mean , i feel sun sensitive whenever i go out , so i am taking all the precautions , with wearing a hat and all of that .\n[doctor] great . i just wanted to make sure you knew about that .\n[patient] yes , i did . thank you .\n[doctor] all right . but i think to help get rid of it sooner rather than later , if insurance will cover the elidel , pick it up and start using it .\n[patient] yeah , i did check . the insurance is not covering it .\n[doctor] it's not ? okay . well , let's look around really quick because if you use a goodrx coupon , it will be around 30 to $ 40 or something .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] let's see .\n[patient] so with your coupon , it was around $ 850 or something .\n[doctor] ugh , yeah . that's way too much .\n[patient] i agree . and- and because i also looked at the eucrisa that you recommended in my notes , and if it's still ex- if it's still expensive , i could try that instead .\n[doctor] yeah , so it ... actually ... it is actually more expensive . i think the prices fluctuate .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] because now it's showing the cheapest of $ 70 , and when i looked before , it was around 30 to $ 40 .\n[patient] yeah . if it was around $ 200 , i would've picked it up . but it was coming to around $ 850 after insurance .\n[doctor] okay . so i've found the cream form . we could try ointment form .\n[patient] you mean the tacrolimus ?\n[doctor] yeah , mm-hmm .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] so if we send it to pick'n save or metro market ... let's see where else .\n[patient] can you do the metro market ?\n[doctor] yeah . let me put in the prescription and we'll see what we can find .\n[patient] sure .\n[doctor] pharmacy is what i'm trying to say .\n[patient] okay . but it's not a steroid , right ?\n[doctor] correct , it's not a steroid .\n[patient] okay , good .\n[doctor] it's called a calcineurin inhibitor . it's kinda like a steroid in that it calms inflammation .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] but it's not a steroid , so do n't use steroids on your face , for sure , as they'll make this kind of rash worse . but also , steroids carry the risk of causing thinning of the skin .\n[patient] all right .\n[doctor] these medications do n't cause thinning of the skin and they're not going to cause some other kind of rash . um , the thing to know is that sometimes five to 10 minutes after you put it on , it can cause this weird kind of tingly or needle-like sensation or make it redder or flush . but it should only last a few seconds and then go away . it's not an allergy or anything bad .\n[patient] okay . got it .\n[doctor] so it only lasts a couple seconds . it does n't mean it's going to happen again . it's nothing bad . it will still work , so keep using it as long as you know you can stand it , okay ?\n[patient] okay , thank you for explaining .\n[doctor] so i will say , \" apply to rash on face twice daily , until resolved . \"\n[patient] okay . so only apply to the rash area ?\n[doctor] yes , and keep using the face wash.\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] i think you could just do it once a day . i do n't think you need to do it twice a day , just because i do n't wan na dry your sky out too much , okay ?\n[patient] i never noticed that my face is dry or got thin . i feel so good after using it .\n[doctor] i understand , but it could get dry and i do n't wan na create other problems for you .\n[patient] all right . i'll just wash once a day with it . but it was feeling very good , like there's this little bit of moisture getting back in . with the other wash , when i would use it twice a day , i was drying out . but not with this one .\n[doctor] i see . okay . well then do what feels good . if you do notice that you're starting to get dry , then reduce to once per day .\n[patient] that sounds good .\n[doctor] so to review , um , continue using the same face wash , continue with metro cream , and increase the use of doxycycline to twice a day .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] and then just do it until it's gone , and then do it for once a day for another week before stopping .\n[patient] okay , sounds good .\n[doctor] all right . and i'll rewrite your instructions here .\n[patient] thank you so much .\n[doctor] if there are any other questions or you're getting different instructions , feel free to reach out to me and we'll clarify , okay ?\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] but in general , doxycycline is such a low risk . we're not gon na have you on this forever . but especially since we're adding the tacrolimus , i expect it will clear quickly .\n[patient] sounds good .\n[doctor] all right . and i just wan na really help knock it out as fast as possible , since you've been dealing with it for so long now . i would take it twice a day until it's gone , and then once a day for a week before you stop . i'll write it out like that . so twice a day until rash is gone , and then once a day for another week before stopping .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] once the rash stops , you can stop the tacrolimus ointment . um , continue doxycycline another week and then stop . but you can keep using the wash and the metro cream .\n[patient] okay , that sounds good . i can do that .\n[doctor] and then hold off until i see you again before you start back any of your old products . um , if it's starting to flair again , um , if it's just a little bit , you can try just doing the tacrolimus for a couple days , to see if that's enough . if it's not , then restart the dy- doxycycline as well .\n[patient] all right .\n[doctor] i do n't expect that to happen , but , you know , if it does , you have the tools . um , then you'll be seeing me for a followup . we can figure out what to do next . i would say if it's getting worse rather than better , just give me a call or send me a mychart message , okay ?\n[patient] yeah , sounds good .\n[doctor] do you have enough refills ?\n[patient] yeah , i think so .\n[doctor] okay . so it looks like you have another refill of the doxycycline , so you're good there . metro cream , you probably still have enough of that one .\n[patient] yes , i do .\n[doctor] all right . and i'll cancel the elidel cream , just so we do n't complicate your list . uh , you have plenty of the face wash still .\n[patient] yes .\n[doctor] okay . uh , and we'll get rid of the clindamycin from your list as well .\n[patient] and what would you suggest for a moisturizer ?\n[doctor] yeah , so for that i would do something really basic like vanicream . or even , if it's just really dry , you could use a little bit of petroleum jelly . um , i'll give you a couple samples , okay ? let's make sure we have a followup in about four weeks .\n[patient] okay , thank you .\n[doctor] okay . and i would stay away from any kind of anti-aging thing , any kind of plant thing . um , really let's just be sure we talk about any new products , or reach out to me if you're gon na try something else . um , let's go get those samples .\n[patient] okay , that sounds good .\n[doctor] for assessment and plan , perioral dermatitis , rosacea , including ocular rosacea , and copy and paste her patient instructions . i recommend that she gently wash her eyelids once a day with gentle cleanser such as vanicream , also use bruder mask as needed .\n</conversation>\nThe generated note will be provided in these tags:\n<response>\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:\nJacqueline Miller presents with persistent facial erythema and faint erythematous papules on bilateral medial cheeks, likely related to perioral dermatitis and rosacea. She reports improvement with previous treatments but notes a plateau in healing. She has been using doxycycline, initially twice daily, then reduced to once daily, with some improvement. She stopped doxycycline temporarily to avoid breastfeeding but resumed it after discussion. She also uses topical metronidazole cream and sulfacetamide wash. She is concerned about residual rash and potential medication side effects. No current use of lotions or wipes, but is interested in appropriate moisturizers.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM:\nPatient has Fitzpatrick skin type IV-V. Examination reveals faint erythematous papules on bilateral medial cheeks with surrounding redness, particularly around and beneath the nostrils. Skin appears mildly inflamed but not excessively dry or thin. No other skin lesions or signs of active infection noted.\n\nRESULTS:\nClinical assessment confirms perioral dermatitis and rosacea. No adverse reactions observed at the examination. Review of medication and skincare regimen indicates adherence, with some plateau in improvement. No laboratory or imaging results available at this visit.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\n- Continue doxycycline 100 mg twice daily until rash resolves, then reduce to once daily for one week before discontinuation.\n- Initiate topical tacrolimus ointment (a calcineurin inhibitor) applied twice daily to affected areas until resolution.\n- Continue metronidazole cream and sulfacetamide wash as currently used.\n- Add a gentle moisturizer such as vanicream or petroleum jelly to maintain skin hydration.\n- Advise sun protection measures due to doxycycline-induced photosensitivity.\n- Follow-up in approximately four weeks to assess response.\n- Discontinue Elidel and clindamycin topical as previously instructed.\n- Educate patient on potential transient sensations with tacrolimus application and importance of adherence.\n- Counsel to avoid steroids and harsh skincare products; monitor for flare-ups and contact provider if worsening occurs.\n- Provide samples of moisturizer and ensure patient understands skincare regimen.\n- Plan for follow-up to evaluate treatment efficacy and adjust as needed.\n</response>\nThe reference note will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nCHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nFollow-up for perioral dermatitis.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nJacqueline Miller is a 40-year-old female who is being seen today for a follow-up skin exam for perioral dermatitis. She also has a history of rosacea, including ocular rosacea. Today, she states that her perioral dermatitis is well-controlled, although it has not fully resolved. The patient was applying doxycycline twice a day with improvement, but her pharmacist advised her to reduce to once daily since it had started to improve; therefore, for approximately the past week, she has been using the doxycycline only once per day. She has not seen continued improvement but it has not worsened. She is using the sulfacetamide wash twice daily, denies drying of the skin, and reports that her skin is much improved moisturization. She also applies MetroCream immediately after using the sulfacetamide wash. She denies using other lotions and products, Cetaphil lotion or soap, or Neutrogena wipes. The patient did not begin Elidel because it is not covered by her insurance, and she was concerned about possible side effects from the medication.\n\nPAST HISTORY\n\nMedical\nPerioral dermatitis.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS\n\nDoxycycline cream. Apply twice daily.\nMetroCream. \nSulfacetamide wash. Apply topically twice daily.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nIntegumentary\nSkin inspection of the face was performed today. On bilateral medial cheeks, there are a few, very faint, erythematous papules with mild redness around and underneath the nostrils. Fitzpatrick skin type is 4 to 5.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\n\u2022 Perioral dermatitis\n\u2022 Rosacea, including ocular rosacea\n\nJacqueline Miller is a 40-year-old female who presented today for follow-up for her perioral dermatitis, which has improved but not resolved. She decreased her doxycycline per her pharmacist\u2019s recommendation, which possibly stagnated the resolution of symptoms.\n\nPLAN\n\nPerioral dermatitis.\nI counseled the patient about the risks and benefits of doxycycline and recommended she resume twice daily application until she reaches full resolution, and at that point she should reduce application to once a day for an additional week. The patient will not be using Elidel as I reviewed the cost of the medication and without insurance, it was too expensive. I provided a prescription for Tacrolimus and counseled her on possible side effects of using the medication. She will continue with Sulfacetamide face wash once a day. Also, use Bruder mask as needed.\n\nRosacea, including ocular rosacea.\nContinue using MetroCream twice daily. I recommended to gently wash her eyelids once daily with a gentle cleanser and try a gentle cream such as Vanicream.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nCall the clinic if symptoms worsen. The patient will have a follow-up appointment in 4 weeks.\n</gold_response>\nCarefully review the <response> based on the <conversation> and compare it to the <gold_response> when needed.\n\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Does the note provide correct clinical information based on the conversation?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the note include all important medical details from the conversation?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the note written clearly and organized in a standard clinical format for clinicians\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

    "predicted_text": "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:\nBobby presents with a several-week history of episodic right upper quadrant abdominal pain described as squeezing and severe (rated 8/10 during episodes), often occurring immediately after or a few hours post-meal. The pain is associated with nausea and occasional low-grade fevers, but no vomiting. He reports persistent pain despite dietary modifications, including a recent low-carb, keto diet aimed at managing his type 2 diabetes. He notes that fatty foods, such as pork rinds, exacerbate his symptoms. His family history includes gallbladder disease in both parents.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM:\nVital signs are within normal limits: BP 128/88 mmHg, HR 68 bpm, RR 16, SpO2 99%, afebrile. Abdominal exam reveals a soft, nondistended abdomen with positive bowel sounds and mild guarding in the right upper quadrant. No rebound tenderness observed. Murphy's sign is positive, indicating pain upon deep inspiration during right upper quadrant palpation. No peritoneal signs noted. Lung and heart exams are unremarkable.\n\nRESULTS:\nAbdominal ultrasound shows multiple gallstones with mild gallbladder wall thickening, suggestive of mild cholecystitis. The common bile duct measures 4.1 mm, within normal limits. No evidence of biliary obstruction.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\nThe patient is diagnosed with mild cholecystitis secondary to gallstones. Given persistent symptoms despite dietary modifications and ultrasound findings, laparoscopic cholecystectomy is recommended and scheduled. Postoperative recovery is expected to be quick, with activity restrictions for the first 24 hours and gradual return to normal activity within a week. The patient is advised to avoid high-fat foods post-surgery and maintain a high-fiber diet. He is also counseled to follow up with his primary care or endocrinologist to monitor his diabetes management, especially around the time of surgery. The patient expressed understanding and has no further questions.",

these tags:\n<conversation>\nDoctor-patient dialogue:\n\n[doctor] hey good morning bobby how are you\n[patient] i'm doing okay i as you're aware doctor miller sent me over for this pain in my belly that i've had for several weeks they did he did an ultrasound and and said i had gallstones and they recommended i stay several way from some high fat food but i'm just still having a lot of pain and he referred me to you\n[doctor] alright well i'm i'm sorry to hear that you're having pain but i i'm glad that he sent you over to see me i wan na talk a little bit more about that pain can you describe the kind of pain that you feel\n[patient] well it's it's on the right hand side of my belly it's it's right underneath my ribs and it feels like a a squeezing severe pain it comes and goes but when it comes it's really severe and i get kind of nauseated and sick in my stomach\n[doctor] okay and then when you get that pain can you rate that pain for me on a scale like zero being none ten being the worst pain you've ever been in your life\n[patient] when it's severe it's it's probably an eight\n[doctor] okay alright and then time wise are we looking at can it just come and go anytime or is it specifically around mealtimes how how does that pain kinda wax and wane for you\n[patient] most of the time it comes right after i eat\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] but it also can come on a couple of hours after i eat also so it's either immediately after i eat or a couple hours later but it's related to eating\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] you know i like to eat right\n[doctor] do n't weigh all so speaking of eating let's talk a little bit about your diet i see here on your chart that you're a type two diabetic and it looked like that you were gon na handle that with diet and exercise let's talk about that a little bit\n[patient] well you know i my my diet was worse when i before i was diagnosed with the the type two diabetes\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] and since then i've cut back on sugar and i started a little bit of a keto diet and i've lost about twenty five pounds over the last three months\n[doctor] okay so other than the weight loss how how is your diet is that has that been working out for you i mean do you does does that does that fit your lifestyle pretty well\n[patient] yeah it does it does it it i was surprised it was n't as hard as i thought to go back and cut back and go more of a keto diet\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] but you know trying to cut out all those carbs my symptoms got better\n[doctor] yeah\n[patient] with the diabetes and my my blood sugars are improving but i still get that pain underneath the ribs\n[doctor] yeah and that can happen and one of those things that causes that is that those intake of that fatty foods which is you know kind of the the keystone or the hallmark of the keto diet and have you noticed any improvement when you do cut out that fatty food and has that been difficult since you are watching your carb intake\n[patient] the fatty food it is a little bit difficult you know i like those pork grinds and you know i i've had to kind of cut those out they were a nice staple for me when i was on the keto diet but i have cut out the those pork rinses because those were just so delicious and you know i would say it's a little bit better but i still get that pain\n[doctor] okay and then do you have any family history of gallbladder disease\n[patient] yeah but you know you know i knew that was coming both my dad and my mother both had gallbladder disease and had to have their gallbladders off\n[doctor] okay so both both your parents your mom and your dad had your had their gallbladders taken out\n[patient] yeah\n[doctor] okay and then i wan na talk a little bit about your activity level and your and and if you're exercising has this affected your ability to to get out and exercise\n[patient] not really i mean i usually i got ta watch it around meals you know but i've never been a big exerciser right after eating anyhow but you know i'm i'm so glad springs here because it gives me that opportunity to get back out and you know i love photography i i love nature of photography and with the with the the woods going from you know that dark barron look to coming alive with that green and and butting i i love to get out and take foot photographs there\n[doctor] that's awesome to hear yeah i my wife and i like to go over and take nature hikes through the new park behind the rex center that just opened up have you ever been over there to do any any picture taken we've got a bunch of beautiful nature pictures that we took about a week ago\n[patient] no i have n't been there i might have to try that out yeah\n[doctor] yeah it's awesome\n[patient] i like to get down near the river that's where i i like to catch especially around spring time\n[doctor] that's great yeah next time you come in maybe you can bring in some of your pictures that'd be awesome to see\n[patient] okay cool\n[doctor] so i'm just curious talking about your symptoms here have you had any fevers you mentioned something about nausea but have you actually vomited from those symptoms\n[patient] there's times when the pain is really bad for a couple of days i've had some what i i would describe as low grade fevers and yes you're right i have feel nauseated but i have n't thrown up\n[doctor] okay so if it's okay with you i'm gon na go ahead and do a quick physical exam your vital signs look good today blood pressure was one twenty eight over eighty eight respiratory rate was sixteen your pulse rate was sixty eight you were afebrile today which is a good thing and your oxygen saturation on room air was ninety nine percent taking a listen to your heart here your heart is regular of rate and rhythm no i do n't hear any ectopic beats no clicks rubs or murmurs noted listening to your lungs here they are clear and equal bilaterally to auscultation now i'm gon na go ahead and do an an abdominal exam i do note positive bowel sounds soft nondistended abdomen however you are positive for some slight guarding there to the right upper quadrant but i do n't note any rebound tenderness now i'm gon na press slightly here beneath your ribs on the right hand side now take a breath in does that hurt when i press\n[doctor] so i i see that you're guarded there so i'm gon na say that that it did hurt when i it did hurt when i\n[patient] absolutely that hurts so much when you push right there\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] sorry i was just trying to capture capture my breath\n[doctor] okay that's that's no problem so you are positive for murphy's signs but i do n't appreciate any peritoneal signs so let's talk a little bit about your results that i reviewed before you came in today so your abdominal ultrasound shows multiple gallstones present in the gallbladder and i do appreciate some mild thickening now the common bile duct size is within normal limits at four . one millimeters now let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you okay i do believe you have some mild cholecystitis with gallstones i do n't appreciate any frank obstruction but it looks like your gallbladder is inflamed and it looks like that's happened maybe over the last few weeks since you've been having those symptoms now since you have n't had any improvement with dietary modifications i am going to make the recommendation that we do remove your gallbladder and i would like to perform a laparoscopic cholecystectomy now what that means is i'll make a few small incisions and insert a scope with some of those instruments that's gon na remove that gallbladder through one of those little bitty incisions now the surgery is gon na take about an hour to an hour and a half and you'll probably spend the night in the hospital because we just wan na monitor you post procedure to make sure everything is okay you're still gon na wan na avoid those high fat foods after surgery and eat foods that are gon na be high in fiber now do you have any questions about what our assessment and plan is for for this\n[patient] no no questions today\n[doctor] okay now the other thing\n[patient] how soon can i how soon will i be able to get up and get moving back outside after the surgery\n[doctor] so the good news is since it's a laparoscopic procedure you're gon na be back on your feet pretty quick now for the first twenty four hours i'm gon na want you to take it pretty easy but after a couple of days if you feel like moving around on some solid ground you know we do n't want you hiking or anything like that but if you feel like moving around on some solid ground you can get up and walk around within a day or two and then in about a week or so i'll see you again and then we'll release you to go get back out there in nature\n[patient] okay thank you very much\n[doctor] you're very welcome the other thing i wan na talk briefly about is now your not your type two diabetes i want you to follow up with your physician just to make sure that you're handling your diabetes especially the fact that you're gon na have surgery and those type of things and we will just continue to monitor your diabetes as has been outlined by your your additional either your endocrinologist or your primary care provider i'm gon na have the nurse come in and get some paperwork signed and if you do n't have any questions for me i will see you next week and we will get this gallbladder out\n[patient] well thank you very much i'm looking forward to i i do n't want

tags:\n<response>\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:\nBobby presents with a several-week history of episodic right upper quadrant abdominal pain described as squeezing and severe (rated 8/10 during episodes), often occurring immediately after or a few hours post-meal. The pain is associated with nausea and occasional low-grade fevers, but no vomiting. He reports persistent pain despite dietary modifications, including a recent low-carb, keto diet aimed at managing his type 2 diabetes. He notes that fatty foods, such as pork rinds, exacerbate his symptoms. His family history includes gallbladder disease in both parents.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM:\nVital signs are within normal limits: BP 128/88 mmHg, HR 68 bpm, RR 16, SpO2 99%, afebrile. Abdominal exam reveals a soft, nondistended abdomen with positive bowel sounds and mild guarding in the right upper quadrant. No rebound tenderness observed. Murphy's sign is positive, indicating pain upon deep inspiration during right upper quadrant palpation. No peritoneal signs noted. Lung and heart exams are unremarkable.\n\nRESULTS:\nAbdominal ultrasound shows multiple gallstones with mild gallbladder wall thickening, suggestive of mild cholecystitis. The common bile duct measures 4.1 mm, within normal limits. No evidence of biliary obstruction.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\nThe patient is diagnosed with mild cholecystitis secondary to gallstones. Given persistent symptoms despite dietary modifications and ultrasound findings, laparoscopic cholecystectomy is recommended and scheduled. Postoperative recovery is expected to be quick, with activity restrictions for the first 24 hours and gradual return to normal activity within a week. The patient is advised to avoid high-fat foods post-surgery and maintain a high-fiber diet. He is also counseled to follow up with his primary care or endocrinologist to monitor his diabetes management, especially around the time of surgery. The patient expressed understanding and has no further questions.\n</response>\nThe reference note will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nCHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nAbdominal pain.\n\nMEDICAL HISTORY\n\nPatient reports history of type 2 diabetes.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nPatient reports enjoying nature photography.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY\n\nPatient reports family history of cholelithiasis. Both of his parents have had cholecystectomies.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nConstitutional: Reports low-grade fevers.\nGastrointestinal: Reports right-sided abdominal pain and nausea. Denies vomiting.\n\nVITALS\n\nBlood Pressure: 128/88 mmHg.\nRespiratory Rate: 16 breaths per minute.\nHeart Rate: 68 beats per minute.\nOxygen Saturation: 99% on room air.\nBody Temperature: Afebrile.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nRespiratory\n- Auscultation of Lungs: Clear and equal bilaterally.\n\nCardiovascular\n- Auscultation of Heart: Regular rate and rhythm. No ectopic beats. No murmurs, clicks, or rubs.\n\nGastrointestinal\n- Examination of Abdomen: Soft, nondistended abdomen. Positive slight guarding to the right upper quadrant, but without rebound tenderness. Positive for Murphy signs. Peritoneal signs not appreciated.\n- Auscultation: Bowel sounds normal in all 4 quadrants.\n\nRESULTS\n\nAbdominal ultrasound obtained at an outside facility is reviewed today. This demonstrates multiple gallstones present in the gallbladder. I do appreciate some mild thickening. The common bile duct size is within normal limits at 4.1 mm.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN\n\n1. Mild cholecystitis with gallstones.\n- Medical Reasoning: Based on the patient's symptoms, exam findings, and ultrasound, I do believe he has some mild cholecystitis with gallstones. I do not appreciate any frank obstruction, but it looks like his gallbladder is inflamed. This appears to have happened maybe over the last few weeks or since he has been symptomatic.\n- Patient Education and Counseling: I had a thorough discussion with the patient concerning surgical treatment. The preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative courses of care were described and discussed. I explained the surgery will take approximately 1 to 1.5 hours, and he will probably spend the night in the hospital for post-procedure monitoring. We also discussed that he should avoid high fat foods after surgery and eat foods that are high in fiber. All questions were answered.\n- Medical Treatment: Since he has not had any improvement with dietary modifications, I recommend a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. A mutually agreed upon surgical date has been scheduled for 1 week.\n\n2. Type 2 diabetes.\n- Medical Reasoning: The patient is currently managing his diabetes with diet and exercise.\n- Patient Education and Counseling: I advised the patient he should refrain from hiking in the immediate postoperative period; however, he may return to walking outdoors on solid ground 1 week status post-surgery.\nMedical Treatment: I recommended he follow up with his physician regarding his impending surgery. We will continue to monitor his diabetes as has been outlined by either his endocrinologist or his primary care provider.\n\nPatient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nThe patient will follow up with me 1 week status post-surgery.\n</gold_response>\nCarefully review the <response> based on the <conversation> and compare it to the <gold_response> when needed.\n\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Does the note provide correct clinical information based on the conversation?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the note include all important medical details from the conversation?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the note written clearly and organized in a standard clinical format for clinicians\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

The patient sustained this injury 4 days ago, when he was tackled a couple of times playing pick up football and landed on his right shoulder. He states that he was able to return to the game, however he has had pain since that time. The patient locates his pain to the posterior aspect of his shoulder. He denies any numbness or tingling in his fingers. He states that the strength in his hand is okay; however, he has been trying to avoid lifting anything too heavy. Mr. Allen denies being able to touch his shoulder to his ear because of pain. The patient has been taking Tylenol for pain, which does not provide relief. He denies any neck problems or other joint problems. The patient denies any previous orthopedic injuries to his right shoulder. He denies any fever or chills since the injury, but does note a headache. The patient states that he hit his head at the time of the injury but did not pass out.\n\nSURGICAL HISTORY\n\nThe patient has a history of an appendectomy 3 to 4 years ago.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nConstitutional: Denies fever or chills.\nMusculoskeletal: Reports right shoulder pain.

He initially experienced severe pain with support issues and tingling in his right toes, which resolved within an hour. The pain has persisted intermittently, especially with certain movements or during sleep, characterized by sharp episodes that improve with proper positioning. He has tried over-the-counter medications (Tylenol, ibuprofen), heat, and ice without significant relief. He has not experienced ongoing numbness, tingling, or weakness in his legs, except for occasional sensations when the injury first occurred. He is concerned about the duration of symptoms and desires further evaluation.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM:\nVital signs are within normal limits: BP 117/56 mmHg, HR 68 bpm, SpO2 95% on room air, afebrile. Neck exam shows bony protuberance at C5-C6 but no pain on palpation. Lumbar spine exam reveals decreased flexion and extension, positive straight leg raise, and paraspinal muscle spasm. No tenderness on palpation of the lumbar spine. Lower extremity strength is symmetric bilaterally. No sensory deficits noted during exam.\n\nRESULTS:\nLumbar spine X-ray showed no acute bony abnormalities or fractures. Physical exam findings suggest possible disc herniation. No signs of bladder or bowel dysfunction or incontinence.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\nJeremy likely has a chronic lumbar disc herniation contributing to his symptoms. An MRI of the lumbar spine will be ordered to evaluate soft tissue structures and confirm the diagnosis. He will be referred to physical therapy for conservative management. Prescribed meloxicam 15 mg once daily for pain and inflammation. Discussed potential future treatments such as epidural steroid injections if symptoms persist or worsen. No current neurological deficits or red flag symptoms. Follow-up to review MRI results and adjust treatment plan accordingly.",

tingling periodically in your feet or is that completely gone\n[patient] that's completely gone it it just happened when i first felt the the tweak in my lower back i felt that sensation but i have n't since\n[doctor] okay and how about any difficulty or weakness in your legs\n[patient] only if i'm carrying something heavy otherwise it seems relatively normal but i i feel the sensation so i'm a little nervous about carrying something heavy\n[doctor] okay and are and do you still have pain down there in your lower back if i turn a certain way or if i roll over in my sleep i'll wake up from it from a like a sharp pain but then that that goes away if i if i position myself the right way okay and what have you been taking for the pain\n[patient] i took some tylenol i took some ibuprofen i've tried heat i've tried ice and nothing really seems to help\n[doctor] okay is the ibuprofen any better than the tylenol\n[patient] a little bit but for sure a shorter period of time\n[doctor] okay and did you get any stomach upset from the ibuprofen\n[patient] no i try not to take too much so i i do n't have an upset stomach from it\n[doctor] okay and did you go to like an urgent care centing or an emergency room have you had any imaging on this at all\n[patient] i went to an urgent care and they wanted me to do an mri but i was a little concerned because i think we maxed out our insurance so i i did n't do it because it started to feel better but because it's been going on so long i'm i'm a little bit concerned now i i do wan na actually move forward with that\n[doctor] okay alright and any other symptoms any problems with like your bladder or your bowels any incontinence or you know you feel like you ca n't go to the bathroom\n[patient] no i have n't had any of those issues\n[doctor] okay alright and any other any other past medical history do you that you have any\n[patient] i had knee surgery about two years ago on my right knee\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] that went fine i rehabbed it pt has been fine it it feels about ninety five percent ever since\n[doctor] okay and what did you have done to your right knee\n[patient] it was a total knee replacement\n[doctor] okay a total knee replacement in twenty eighteen is that what you said\n[patient] no it was actually about two years ago so it's the spring of twenty twenty\n[doctor] okay alright alright well i wan na go ahead and just move on to a physical exam i'm gon na be calling out some of my exam findings\n[patient] mm-hmm\n[doctor] now you have you had any fever or chills with this\n[patient] no\n[doctor] okay alright alright so looking at your vital signs here in the office you know they look really good your you you do n't have any temperature your blood pressure is good it's about one seventeen over fifty six\n[patient] mm-hmm\n[doctor] your heart rate is nice and slow at sixty eight and your oxygenation is fine at ninety five percent on room air so that means everything looks good\n[patient] good\n[doctor] on your neck exam i i do appreciate some bony protuberance of the c5 c6 do you have any pain when i touch here\n[patient] no\n[doctor] no okay on your lumbar spine exam i do appreciate do you have pain when i touch here\n[patient] no\n[doctor] okay so there is no pain to palpation of the lumbar spine there is decreased flexion and extension of the lower back the patient does have a positive straight leg raise and there is some spasm of the paraspinal muscles of the lumbar spine on musculoskeletal exam the lower extremities strength is equal bilaterally so what does that mean jeremy that means that you have some you know maybe a some arthritis in your neck here and or maybe just a a little bit of some injury from from that from that back that back thing that you told me about\n[patient] mm-hmm\n[doctor] okay but i think overall things look really good so you know i had them do an lumbar spine x-ray on you before i saw you and i looked at the results of your lumbar spine x-ray which showed no acute bony abnormality you know there was no fracture of your back or anything which is not surprising based on your history so let's just talk a little bit about my assessment and plan so i do believe it sounds like you have an acute disk herniation now this did happen a few months ago but it sounds like that's what you had based on the fact that you're still having symptoms\n[patient] mm-hmm\n[doctor] i do wan na go ahead and order a a lumbar spine mri to get a a a better look at what's going on you know x-rays really just look at the bones they do n't show us any of the soft tissue so let's go ahead and order the lumbar spine mri i wan na continue with physical therapy so i'm going to refer you to a a physical therapist through our health system\n[patient] mm-hmm\n[doctor] and then i also wan na go ahead and prescribe meloxicam fifteen milligrams once a day\n[patient] mm-hmm\n[doctor] to help with that do you have any questions about that\n[patient] no questions\n[doctor] now if you do have a herniated disk we can go ahead and talk about some other treatment options maybe like an epidural steroid injection to help take down some of that inflammation\n[patient] mm-hmm\n[doctor] it might make you feel better but we'll we'll deal with that when we get get there okay\n[patient] sure\n[doctor] any questions\n[patient] not at this point\n[doctor] okay great thank you\n[patient] thank you\n</conversation>\nThe generated note will be provided in these tags:\n<response>\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:\nJeremy reports injuring his lower back approximately four months ago while moving boxes during his son's move-out. He initially experienced severe pain with support issues and tingling in his right toes, which resolved within an hour. The pain has persisted intermittently, especially with certain movements or during sleep, characterized by sharp episodes that improve with proper positioning. He has tried over-the-counter medications (Tylenol, ibuprofen), heat, and ice without significant relief. He has not experienced ongoing numbness, tingling, or weakness in his legs, except for occasional sensations when the injury first occurred. He is concerned about the duration of symptoms and desires further evaluation.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM:\nVital signs are within normal limits: BP 117/56 mmHg, HR 68 bpm, SpO2 95% on room air, afebrile. Neck exam shows bony protuberance at C5-C6 but no pain on palpation. Lumbar spine exam reveals decreased flexion and extension, positive straight leg raise, and paraspinal muscle spasm. No tenderness on palpation of the lumbar spine. Lower extremity strength is symmetric bilaterally. No sensory deficits noted during exam.\n\nRESULTS:\nLumbar spine X-ray showed no acute bony abnormalities or fractures. Physical exam findings suggest possible disc herniation. No signs of bladder or bowel dysfunction or incontinence.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\nJeremy likely has a chronic lumbar disc herniation contributing to his symptoms. An MRI of the lumbar spine will be ordered to evaluate soft tissue structures and confirm the diagnosis. He will be referred to physical therapy for conservative management. Prescribed meloxicam 15 mg once daily for pain and inflammation. Discussed potential future treatments such as epidural steroid injections if symptoms persist or worsen. No current neurological deficits or red flag symptoms. Follow-up to review MRI results and adjust treatment plan accordingly.\n</response>\nThe reference note will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nJeremy Adams is a pleasant 57-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of low back pain. The onset of his pain began 4 months ago, when he was moving boxes out of his son\u2019s college dorm. At that time, he noted tingling in his right toes, which resolved after approximately 1 hour. After his injury, he felt as though he was unable to support his upper body weight. The patient reports weakness in his legs when carrying heavy objects. He reports a sharp pain in his lower back when he turns a certain way or rolls over in his sleep. The pain will resolve with repositioning. The patient was seen at urgent care and was referred to obtain an MRI, however he did not undergo this secondary to insurance issues. He has been utilizing Tylenol, ibuprofen, heat, and ice for pain, which does not provide relief. The patient notes the ibuprofen is slightly more beneficial than the Tylenol, however it does not relieve his symptoms. He denies upset stomach with the use of ibuprofen. Additionally, he attempted physical therapy at his gym without any relief. He denies any bladder or bowels issues, fevers, and chills.\n\nSURGICAL HISTORY\n\nThe patient has a history of a right total knee arthroplasty 2 years ago, in spring of 2020. He states that his right knee feels 95% improved since the surgery.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nConstitutional: Denies fevers or chills.\nGastrointestinal: Denies bowel issues.\nGenitourinary: Denies bladder issues.\nMusculoskeletal: Reports lower back pain.\n\nVITALS\n\nTemperature: Normal.\nBlood pressure: 117/56 mm Hg.\nHeart rate: 68 BPM.\nOxygenation: 95% on room air.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nNECK: Bony protuberance of the C5-C6. No pain to palpation of the C5-C6\nMSK: Examination of the Lumbar spine: No pain to palpation of the lumbar spine. Decreased flexion and extension of the lower back. Positive straight leg raise. Spasm of the paraspinal muscles of the lumbar spine. Strength is equal bilaterally.\n\nRESULTS\n\nX-rays of the lumbar spine were reviewed. These reveal no acute bony abnormalities.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nLow back pain, possible acute disc herniation.\n\nPLAN\n\nAfter reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. His x-rays did not reveal any signs of a fracture. I would like to obtain an MRI of the lumbar spine to evaluate for a possible acute disc herniation. I have prescribed the patient meloxicam 15 mg to treat his pain. He will continue with physical therapy and a referral was provided for this today.\n</gold_response>\nCarefully review the <response> based on the <conversation> and compare it to the <gold_response> when needed.\n\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Does the note provide correct clinical information based on the conversation?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the note include all important medical details from the conversation?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the note written clearly and organized in a standard clinical format for clinicians\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

He reports coughing up blood (approximately 3-4 cups daily) for about three weeks, with no associated fevers, chest pain, or other bleeding. He denies leg swelling or recent travel. He has a history of knee pain but no recent trauma or swelling. His blood sugars have been poorly controlled recently, with post-meal glucose levels exceeding 200 mg/dL and fasting levels around 150 mg/dL. He reports inconsistent use of antihypertensive medication due to episodes of low blood pressure.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM:\nVital signs: Oxygen saturation 94% on pulse oximetry, blood pressure approximately 120/70 mmHg (sometimes in the 90s), pulse regular. No jugular venous distension or neck swelling. Lung exam reveals some crackles and rhonchi, predominantly on the right side, with diminished breath sounds on the right. Cardiac exam shows a longstanding systolic ejection murmur, unchanged. Abdomen is soft and non-tender. Extremity exam shows 1+ non-pitting edema in both ankles; no calf tenderness or Homan's sign.\n\nRESULTS:\nNo immediate lab results available; however, plans include chest X-ray and chest CT to evaluate for pulmonary pathology such as infection or blood clots. Blood work will be obtained in the emergency department to assess for possible causes of hemoptysis and other abnormalities.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\nDennis presents with shortness of breath and hemoptysis likely due to a pulmonary process, possibly pneumonia or a pulmonary embolism. He will be referred to the emergency department for urgent imaging (chest X-ray and CT scan) and blood tests to evaluate for blood clots or infection. His current antihypertensive medication (Norvasc) will be held pending further assessment. His poorly controlled diabetes will be addressed by increasing metformin dosage from 500 mg BID to 750 mg BID, with follow-up in three weeks to reassess glycemic control. No immediate changes to blood pressure medications will be made until further evaluation. Patient is advised that he can bike to the ED and has no further questions.",

coughing up blood\n[patient] no i tried to get an appointment in the office but they were kinda booked up\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] they just numb\n[doctor] alright and alright no but no fevers with this so since you're here your oxygen level looks pretty good in the clinic it's about ninety four percent on pulse your pulse oxygenation so that's good are you short of breath so when you walk or you or you exert yourself you're short of breath you said right okay and have you and how how is your blood sugar been doing since this has been going on i know you're on metformin how's your diabetes

and morning when i get up they are around one fifty\n[doctor] okay alright so it's been running a little bit high i know we checked your hemoglobin a1c last time and it was about seven . seven . i think and we had talked about you know improving your diet and improving some exercise but is this blood sugar been high and low or high and normal when you're especially in the last three weeks or has it been going on for longer than that\n[patient] i would say about a month\n[doctor] okay alright and how is your blood pressure been at home since you've been taking since these episodes that you've been sick are you taking norvasc\n[patient] yes i am but i keep them on some days because my blood pressure has been running somewhat on the low side\n[doctor] okay alright and right now it's about a hundred and twenty over seventy what how low does it go in the more when you check it\n[patient] well there are sometimes in the lower nineties\n[doctor] okay alright well let me let me examine you here in a second and we'll think about you know what we need to do especially with your coughing and your shortness of breath okay so nita i'm i'm examining you now let's pretend i did my exam i'm just gon na verbalize some of my findings so i can put it into my chart okay and i'll explain what those things mean so on my exam you've got no jvd there is no swelling in your neck no carotid bruits your lung exam you've got some rails and some rhonchi on on more on the right side i do n't hear any wheezing right now there is some diminished breath sounds in the right side as well on your heart exam you've got two over successolic ejection murmur you've had that in the past that's unchanged from before the rest regular rate and rhythm otherwise your belly exam is nice and soft on your extremity exam you've got one plus nonpitting edema on both of your lower extremities on your on your ankles no calf tenderness no negative homan sign so what does all this mean so basically you've got you know you've got some sort of infection or something going on in your lungs that i can hear right now the rest of your exam is pretty much stable it's unchanged from before so let's talk about what we what we should do about this so for the for the first problem with the shortness of breath the first thing i wan na do is go ahead and get a chest x-ray for you okay you've been coughing up blood i also wan na send you to the emergency department to get some blood testing done i'm worried about a blood clot or something else going on so i wan na get a cat scan of your chest as well so i'm gon na go ahead and refer you to the emergency department i'll call them and and have you head over that way they can get a chest x-ray and a cat scan and some blood work as well and then we'll evaluate why you're having the shortness of breath and why you're coughing up this blood okay and then depending on what they find you may need you know it could be as simple as a pneumonia or it could be something a little bit more serious we may have to get you know start you know depending on what you find we will get the right treatment started any questions about that or can you drive to the emergency department from here or is that okay\n[patient] yeah i can bike no problem i have no question\n[doctor] alright for the second problem for the diabetes since your blood sugar is running a little bit high once you get over this i'm blood sugars running a little bit high once we get you over this hump of the shortness of breath and get this diagnosed i'm gon na go ahead and order another hemoglobin a1c today we will probably increase your dose of metformin from five hundred twice a day to seven fifty twice a day so why do n't we do that and then why do n't we have we'll have the hemoglobin a1c back and then we can once you get over this illness that you're undergoing we'll we'll we'll discuss that more i'll have you come back in about three weeks to just discuss your diabetes and what our treatment plan will be for that okay\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] for the high blood pressure definitely hold off on the norvasc for right now let's figure out what's going what's causing this episode of shortness of breath i want some blood testing done and and once we have that under better control we can reassess your blood pressure so right now hold the norvasc and then we'll have you come back once everything is done okay\n[patient] no\n[doctor] any other questions or anything we know if we need to talk about today\n[patient] no i'm good\n[doctor] sounds good we'll

    "predicted_text": "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:\nScott presents with a right knee injury sustained approximately three days ago during a pickup soccer game. He reports feeling a pop in the knee at the time of injury, with associated swelling that has somewhat decreased. He describes the knee as feeling unstable and limited in movement, with pain rated between 4-7/10, alleviated somewhat by ibuprofen. He can bend the knee with pain near the end of motion, and straightening requires assistance. He can bear weight but feels the knee is loose. No prior knee issues are noted.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM:\nOn examination, Scott exhibits a marked limp on the right side. There is significant effusion and slight ecchymosis over the right knee. Tenderness is localized to the medial joint line. Passive range of motion is limited, with terminal extension at approximately 115\u00b0, and flexion reduced by 20-30\u00b0 due to pain. Lachman test is positive, indicating anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) instability. Neurovascular exam is intact with 5/5 muscle strength in bilateral lower extremities. Palpation elicits mild pain medially.\n\nRESULTS:\nPhysical findings suggest an ACL tear, supported by a positive Lachman test and joint instability. No neurovascular deficits are present. An MRI is ordered to confirm the diagnosis and assess the extent of ligament injury.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\nScott likely has an ACL tear of the right knee. Management includes ordering an MRI to confirm the diagnosis. Symptomatic treatment with meloxicam 50 mg daily is prescribed to reduce inflammation and pain. He is advised to ice the knee, limit activities, and use a knee immobilizer and crutches to prevent further injury. He should avoid strenuous activities, including jogging, until further evaluation. He is instructed to perform gentle movements to prevent joint stiffness and to limit work activities if sitting causes discomfort. The MRI will guide further treatment, which may include surgical intervention. Follow-up will be scheduled once MRI results are available.",

these tags:\n<conversation>\nDoctor-patient dialogue:\n\n[doctor] alright scott so so i understand that you you had some right knee injury can you tell me a little bit about what happened\n[patient] yeah i was trying to go out and play some pickup soccer games over the weekend and went to go plank kick the ball and and just felt a pop in my right knee\n[doctor] okay and and how long ago did that happen\n[patient] about three days ago\n[doctor] three days okay and when did you notice any swelling anything like that\n[patient] it it's swollen some some of that swelling has gone down\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] but it it mainly just it it feels like that i just i ca n't my knee is just not as functionally it's not moving as well as what it used to be it seems to be a little limited\n[doctor] okay alright and then so how's the pain with your knee on a scale of one to ten one being the least pain ten being the worst pain how's how's it been ranging\n[patient] it's somewhere between six and seven right now it's about four or five with some of the swelling going down\n[doctor] okay alright and did you take anything at all to relieve the pain\n[patient] anti-inflammatories\n[doctor] okay alrighty and did that help\n[patient] yeah the ibuprofen helped a little bit but i'm on it pretty on a pretty regular basis right now\n[doctor] gotcha okay now tell me are you able to bend or straighten your leg ever since then\n[patient] i can bend it but it hurts towards the end of the motion and i can straighten it but it does n't it feels like i have to help get it straightened\n[doctor] okay alright and then how about you able to bear any weight on it or walk on it at all\n[patient] i can still bear weight on it but it feels just really loose it it does n't feel normal\n[doctor] gotcha okay alright well let's go ahead and take a look at your knee here real quick before i take a look at your knee here i'm gon na do a physical exam and in terms of your gait here i did notice that you do have a marked limp on your looks like it's your right leg upon ambulation so let me go ahead and take a look at that right knee real quick i do appreciate some significant effusion in the right knee just a slight bit of ecchymosis let me just feel around here scott how does that feel does that hurt when i kinda press on that there\n[patient] a little bit of pain there not not really bad it's it feels like it's just more on the inside of my knee\n[doctor] yep okay so you definitely feeling some a little bit of pain to palpation at the medial joint line now i'm gon na have you lie on your back and also i'm gon na do some maneuvering here of your leg i'm gon na do a real quick test on you here okay alright how does that feel\n[patient] just feels just feels loose it hurts when you pull it at the very end\n[doctor] okay sorry about that alright so you're definitely having some difficulty with some passive range of motion here and you're lacking a few degrees of terminal extension to about a hundred and fifteen degrees as well as lacking about maybe twenty to thirty degrees of terminal flexion on the secondary secondary to the pain here and you do have a positive lachman exam so one more thing i wan na take a look at real quick i'm gon na take a look at your toes here real quick very good so neurovascularly your bilateral lower extremities are intact and it looks like you have a muscle strength of a five out of five so scott you know based on my examination here your right knee injury is really suggestive of anterior cruciate ligament tear and you've heard of it probably even heard as acl tear sometimes especially when a lot of people do sports and they injure their knee that that can happen so my plan for you though is i wan na i wan na go ahead and order an mri because i wan na evaluate the integrity of that acl now you may need surgery but we'll we'll first take a look at that mri result and reevaluate and reevaluate that first but in the meantime i wan na go ahead and order some anti-inflammatory medication meloxicam fifty milligrams a day it's gon na help reduce that swelling and the pain and then i want you to go ahead and ice the knee if you need to if you're still seeing some swelling and some pain you can go ahead and use ice as well but i definitely would like for you to moderate your activities so i would like for you to wear a knee immobilizer and then also use crutches when you walk around just to help you a little bit so not to put too much stress and strain on that knee does that sound like a plan\n[patient] it it does now well i need to limit my work activities i i typically sit behind a desk but it's not been very comfortable sitting here lately\n[doctor] yeah definitely so yeah so you you can limit the activities for sure in terms of your work activities i know if you sit too long sometimes it can be painful because you do need to move that leg a little bit so it does n't lock up so i i would like for you to you know do do some slight activities not enough to stress your legs but definitely move move them a little bit every now and then so it does n't lock up on you okay\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] alright i do want you to i know you are i know you actually jog often so i want you to just slow that down for a bit no jogging for a while until we get you know results of your mri till we figure out what we what we are gon na be doing okay\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] alright and how's your dog you has it been jogging with you before this incident\n[patient] how's just how's my dog or how is my job\n[doctor] your your dog\n[patient] my my my dog is okay\n[doctor] good\n[patient] is doing really well and and he enjoys still playing around outside but looks like wo n't be able to do that for a little bit\n[doctor] very good alright well i'm gon na go ahead and have the nurse take you to the scheduler to get your mri and i'll get back with you as soon as we get the results of that\n[patient] okay sounds good thank you\n[doctor] thank you\n</conversation>\nThe generated note will be provided in these tags:\n<response>\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:\nScott

The injury occurred 3 days ago, when he was playing pickup soccer games and felt a pop in his right knee. He reports swelling at the time of the injury, which has improved. The patient states that his knee is not as functional or moving as well as it used to be. He rates his pain level as a 6 to 7 out of 10 currently and a 4 to 5 out of 10 when the swelling decreases. The patient has been taking ibuprofen on a regular basis, which provides some relief. He states that he is able to bend his knee with pain towards the end of this motion; however, when he goes to straighten his knee, he feels like he has to help it straight. The patient adds that he is able to bear weight on his right knee, however it feels loose and does not feel normal.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nThe patient works at a desk.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nMusculoskeletal: Reports right knee pain.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nGAIT: Marked limp in the right leg upon ambulation.\nMSK: Examination of the right knee: Significant effusion. Slight ecchymosis. Pain with palpation at the medial joint line. Difficulty with passive ROM. Lacking a few degrees of terminal extension to 115 degrees. Lacking 20-30 degrees of terminal flexion secondary to pain. Positive Lachman's test. Muscle strength is 5/5. Neurovascular intact distally.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nRight knee pain, possible anterior cruciate ligament tear.\n\nPLAN\n\nAfter reviewing the patient's examination findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. I have recommended that we obtain an MRI of the right knee to evaluate the integrity of the ACL. I have prescribed the patient meloxicam 15 mg a day to reduce swelling and pain. We discussed that the patient should utilize ice and activity modification to reduce swelling and pain. I recommended that he wears a knee immobilizer and use crutches when he is ambulating. He will avoid jogging until we have the results of his MRI.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nThe patient will follow up with me once the MRI results are available for review and further discussion.\n</gold_response>\nCarefully review the <response> based on the <conversation> and compare it to the <gold_response> when needed.\n\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Does the note provide correct clinical information based on the conversation?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the note include all important medical details from the conversation?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the note written clearly and organized in a standard clinical format for clinicians\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

    "predicted_text": "**HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:**  \nTeresa presents with a 4-day history of right elbow pain, rated as 7/10, which worsens at night and interferes with sleep. She reports pain localized to the inside of the elbow, with radiation down the medial aspect of her arm. She has been engaging in pottery, specifically working on a ceramic bowl, which involves repetitive wrist movements. She denies any recent trauma or injury to the elbow. She has tried ice and taking ibuprofen without significant relief. No prior elbow injuries are noted.\n\n**PHYSICAL EXAM:**  \nVital signs are within normal limits, with blood pressure 120/70 mmHg, pulse 70 bpm, respiratory rate 18, temperature 97.9\u00b0F, and oxygen saturation 100%. The patient weighs approximately 5 pounds more than previous visit but reports regular walking of 1-2 miles daily. Examination of the right elbow reveals tenderness over the medial epicondyle, pain with resisted pronation, and pain with wrist flexion and flexion against resistance. No swelling, bruising, or discoloration observed. Range of motion is preserved, and neurovascular exam shows equal pulses bilaterally. Lung and heart auscultation are normal.\n\n**RESULTS:**  \nX-ray of the right elbow shows no fractures or bony abnormalities, supporting a diagnosis of tendinopathy rather than fracture or bony pathology.\n\n**ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:**  \nThe patient has medial epicondylitis (golfer\u2019s elbow) likely due to overuse from pottery activities. Management includes rest, immobilization with a sling, ice application three times daily, and NSAIDs (600 mg ibuprofen every 6 hours for one week). She is advised to avoid pottery for a few weeks to allow healing. Follow-up in two weeks is recommended to assess progress; physical therapy may be considered if symptoms persist.  \nFor her diabetes, metformin dosage will be increased to 1000 mg twice daily, with instructions to monitor blood sugars daily and follow up in two weeks. An A1c test will be ordered to evaluate long-term control.  \nHer hypertension remains well-controlled on lisinopril 10 mg daily, which will be continued. A referral to diabetic counseling is suggested to support lifestyle modifications.  \nThe recent elbow x-ray is normal, with no evidence of fracture or bony pathology. Further evaluation with physical therapy may be considered if recovery is delayed.  \nPatient is advised to monitor symptoms and follow up as scheduled.",

yeah so it's hurting on the inside of my elbow\n[doctor] mm-hmm\n[patient] and when i i i've been doing some pottery i've been creating you know i have a pottery wheel and i've been i love my pottery and for my son's birthday i've been making a a ceramic bowl and i'm gon na paint it and i have to do some real full decorations but i've really been working on it a lot and my gosh this is hurting and i ca n't work on it right now because it's hurting so much\n[doctor] i am so sorry so i mean that's really cool that you do parttery it's something that i've wanted to pick up you know but i do n't know that i have those skills yet does the pain radiate down your arm or up your shoulder or anything\n[patient] yeah it does down my arm and along that inside of my arm\n[doctor] okay so the medial aspect okay have you did you hit it on anything\n[patient] no not that i recall\n[doctor] okay and have you ever injured your elbow before\n[patient] no i have n't\n[doctor] okay alright so on a on a scale of one to ten with ten being your arm is actively being sought off by a chainsaw how bad is the pain\n[patient] well i'd say it's about a seven\n[doctor] wow that's pretty bad does it keep you up at night\n[patient] yes it really does it's you know if i roll over and it it it just wakes me up\n[doctor] okay have you done anything to relieve the pain\n[patient] well i have been taking some ibuprofen but that is n't really helping\n[doctor] okay and have you tried anything like ice or heat or anything else\n[patient] i tried a little bit of ice at first\n[doctor] mm-hmm\n[patient] but and it's just it's been hurting for about four days now\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] did n't getting better\n[doctor] okay okay so it's probably it do you think it's getting worse\n[patient] well it's just not getting better\n[doctor] okay no i understand okay so i know that you also have like a history of hypertension and that we have you on ten milligrams of lisinopril have you been checking your blood pressures regularly\n[patient] yeah you know what i remember too i mean they they have been pretty good one teens to one thirties\n[doctor] okay alright and okay do you think that you've been good about taking your medications do you usually take them everyday\n[patient] yeah pretty much i i i you know set an alarm for that lisinopril\n[doctor] awesome that's great alright and so i see that you also we are treating you for diabetes as well and that we have you on five hundred milligrams of metformin twice a day how about that have you been taking that regularly\n[patient] well sometimes i forget i mean having a medication twice a day you know sometimes i'm out doing stuff and i just forget to take it\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] and plus i kinda have a sweet tooth so you know sometimes they're a little bit higher you know like one fifty to one seventy so\n[doctor] okay alright so when you say a sweet tooth what are we talking about there\n[patient] i love to bak also besides my ceramics i'm really big and baking and i like to make cakes and and take them to you know parties and get togethers you know family get togethers and i like to make senna rules too i've been doing that since i was very young so i kinda noticed that\n[doctor] okay cinnamon rolls can be kind of hard like do you for your cakes do you do you use fondant you know to like do any of the decorations\n[patient] no i i mine are just pretty basic they're not overly fancy\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] simpon rolls i got that recipe out of a southern living magazine\n[doctor] oof\n[patient] a long time ago and\n[doctor] so you know it's good\n[patient] yeah\n[doctor] alright well so i totally understand like baking and like the excitement of being able to give those to your family but we maybe wan na start cutting down on eating and taste testing ourselves is do you think that's something we could manage\n[patient] yeah i know i need to get better on it i probably could use maybe a refresher on just managing what i should and should n't eat how like if i need to combine a protein you know if i do eat something a little bit sweet maybe pling a protein or something with it\n[doctor] mm-hmm yeah that sounds like a\n[patient] had some friends tell me something about that\n[doctor] yeah that sounds like a great idea and i think if that's something that we can maybe discuss to get you in contact with someone who can offer you someone with a degree that can offer you some really good advice you know i do n't wan na as much as it's really helpful to have friends i do wan na be able to give you like a source of truth right\n[patient] yeah i i had a diabetic consult a long time ago but yeah it it would be nice to see a dietitian again and go over those and maybe there is some new stuff too\n[doctor] a hundred percent yeah you know like i one of the things that i struggle with is like are eggs good for you or bad for you you know like with cholesterol i feel like it changes every other year or something like that so you're right there may be some pieces of information that we do need to update and and you know over a fresh of course would n't hurt but if you do n't mind i'm gon na go ahead and start my physical exam i'm gon na call out my findings and just go let me know if you have any questions or if anything sounds anything that you you want me to expand on further but this is just for the recording sake so we can get everything documented okay\n[patient] yeah and can i ask you what word what were my vital signs can you show me what my vital signs were\n[doctor] yeah that's uh uh that's a really good question so our big and favorite one is gon na be your blood pressure right so you're right like we are seeing some some definite improvement today it was one twenty over seventy and honestly that's a great place to be so that tells me that your medication is working and that maybe we can start to evaluate a bit more your respiratory rate is completely normal so i see it here as eighteen that's wonderful you are not running a fever so ninety seven . nine and you're honestly that's within like a good enough range for me you're satting pretty well your oxygen saturation is a hundred percent again so that means that you're not experiencing any kind of difficulty getting in that oxygen to the rest of your body i do wan na say that you know pain is one of the vitals that we worry about and you're saying that at it's worst your the pain in your elbow is a seven out of ten so that's something that i'm gon na evaluate and then your pulse rate seems to be appropriate as well so those are all great do you have any questions about that so far\n[patient] no that sounds good yeah i was just curious\n[doctor] yeah\n[patient] checked it in a while so\n[doctor] mm-hmm i do wan na say that like looking at your the weight we do see like maybe a five pound increase from the last time that you were here but that's completely normal right to be able like to fluctuate you know give or take five pounds so i'm not i'm not i'm not like seriously worried about it but if we do come back and notice an additional five pounds then we might have to start talking about like actually you know what let's do that right now what kind of exercise regimen are you on\n[patient] well i do go for some walks in the evening i try to get one in on the morning too\n[doctor] mm-hmm\n[patient] so not a whole lot other than that because i'm busy with my pottery or baking so but i do try to get out and walk daily\n[doctor] okay that's awesome so like how about about how long are your walks\n[patient] well i just walk around the neighborhood there is you know the sidewalks and there is kind of a little bit more of a nature type area that goes across the bridge and so it's probably you know maybe one to two miles a day\n[doctor] wow that's intense i was not expecting that number that's awesome okay alright so maybe this five pounds is muscle we're gon na go for it okay but thank you but that's some really important information but i'm gon na start your physical exam now okay\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] alright so i know that you said that you are experiencing elbow pain could you tell me is it your left or your right elbow\n[patient] it's my right\n[doctor] okay alright right elbow when i touch it does it hurt on the inside\n[patient] yes it does\n[doctor] okay so moderate tenderness at the medial epicondyle when you turn like when you turn your wrist is if you're trying to open a door knob do you experience pain\n[patient] no not really\n[doctor] alright so turning out no pain but when you turn your wrist inwards do you have any pain\n[patient] yeah\n[doctor] okay so pain with resisted pronation of right forearm when you rest your arm on a table with the palm side up alright i want you to raise your hand by bending the wrist do you experiencing any pain\n[patient] yeah that hurts\n[doctor] alright alright so when you are when i'm pressing here and like flexing your wrist are you experiencing any pain\n[patient] yes\n[doctor] alright pain with flexion and when bending the wrist alright when i listen to you you know i'm just gon na check your heart and lungs everything sounds sounds good no murmur no rub no gallop your lungs are clear bilaterally to bilaterally to auscultation i'm not noticing any rash for your at your elbow i do n't notice any bruising any swelling we do wan na note that tenderness but otherwise there is no discoloration no lesions so that's good your pulses and are equal bilaterally and i think i think we have an idea of what we are dealing with here okay so i'm gon na go ahead and give you my impression and plan for your your first problem like your primary problem that you are here for is right elbow pain it's consistent with medial epicondylitis and that it just means it's pain caused from overuse and damage to the tendons in your arm what we are gon na do is rest it i'm gon na order a sling for your right arm and you can wear this while you're awake well i want you to apply ice to your elbow for twenty minutes three times a day i'm going to i'm gon na ask you to take six hundred milligrams of ibuprofen that's three pills every six hours with food and you can take that for one week i know it's really important that you said that you have something that a gift that you wan na make for your son but we're gon na hold off on pottery for the next couple of weeks just to give your arm a chance to heal you know like it's awesome that you wan na be able to do these things for your family but sometimes you know your body is not where your where your where your heart is like where your heart and your head are right and then so\n[patient] i'll i'll just let him know that that i maybe i'll take a picture of what i have so far\n[doctor] absolutely that's awesome and so it'll be like a a movie like coming soon to a shelf near you that's great for your second problem right we have this longstanding diabetes i want to increase your metformin to a thousand milligrams twice a day i know that you're saying you're

 \nTeresa presents with a 4-day history of right elbow pain, rated as 7/10, which worsens at night and interferes with sleep. She reports pain localized to the inside of the elbow, with radiation down the medial aspect of her arm. She has been engaging in pottery, specifically working on a ceramic bowl, which involves repetitive wrist movements. She denies any recent trauma or injury to the elbow. She has tried ice and taking ibuprofen without significant relief. No prior elbow injuries are noted.\n\n**PHYSICAL EXAM:**  \nVital signs are within normal limits, with blood pressure 120/70 mmHg, pulse 70 bpm, respiratory rate 18, temperature 97.9\u00b0F, and oxygen saturation 100%. The patient weighs approximately 5 pounds more than previous visit but reports regular walking of 1-2 miles daily. Examination of the right elbow reveals tenderness over the medial epicondyle, pain with resisted pronation, and pain with wrist flexion and flexion against resistance. No swelling, bruising, or discoloration observed. Range of motion is preserved, and neurovascular exam shows equal pulses bilaterally. Lung and heart auscultation are normal.\n\n**RESULTS:**  \nX-ray of the right elbow shows no fractures or bony abnormalities, supporting a diagnosis of tendinopathy rather than fracture or bony pathology.\n\n**ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:**  \nThe patient has medial epicondylitis (golfer\u2019s elbow) likely due to overuse from pottery activities. Management includes rest, immobilization with a sling, ice application three times daily, and NSAIDs (600 mg ibuprofen every 6 hours for one week). She is advised to avoid pottery for a few weeks to allow healing. Follow-up in two weeks is recommended to assess progress; physical therapy may be considered if symptoms persist.  \nFor her diabetes, metformin dosage will be increased to 1000 mg twice daily, with instructions to monitor blood sugars daily and follow up in two weeks. An A1c test will be ordered to evaluate long-term control.  \nHer hypertension remains well-controlled on lisinopril 10 mg daily, which will be continued. A referral to diabetic counseling is suggested to support lifestyle modifications.  \nThe recent elbow x-ray is normal, with no evidence of fracture or bony pathology. Further evaluation with physical therapy may be considered if recovery is delayed.  \nPatient is advised to monitor symptoms and follow up as scheduled.\n</response>\nThe reference note will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nCHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nRight elbow pain.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nTeresa Sullivan is a pleasant 33-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of right elbow pain. Her pain began 4 days ago, without any improvement. She denies any specific injury; however, she has recently increased her usage of a pottery wheel in creating a bowl for her son. She is currently unable to work with the pottery wheel secondary to pain. Her pain is in the medial aspect of her elbow. She notes it radiates medially down her arm as well. The patient rates her pain level as 7 out of 10 at its worst. She reports the pain wakes her at night if she rolls over. She denies ibuprofen or ice provide pain relief. The patient denies any previous elbow injuries.\n\nThe patient has a history of hypertension. She states she has been checking her blood pressures regularly. She adds that her blood pressures have been in the 110s to 130s range. She affirms she is taking lisinopril 10 mg daily and denies missing doses.\n\nRegarding her diabetes type 2, she reports she sometimes forgets to take metformin 500 mg twice daily. At times, her blood sugar levels range from 150 to 170 mg/dL. She states that she has a sweet tooth and indulges in home baked goods. For exercise, she walks in the evening and in the morning. She walks 1 to 2 miles per day around her neighborhood.\n\nThe patient enjoys working with ceramics as well as baking cakes and cinnamon rolls for family gatherings.\n\nMEDICAL HISTORY\n\nPatient reports history of hypertension and diabetes type 2.\n\nMEDICATIONS\n\nPatient reports taking lisinopril 10 mg and metformin 500 mg twice daily.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nMusculoskeletal: Reports right elbow pain.\n\nVITALS\n\nBlood Pressure: 120/70 mmHg.\nPulse Rate: Appropriate.\nRespiratory Rate: 18 breaths per minute.\nOxygen Saturation: 100% on room air.\nBody Temperature: 97.9 degrees F.\nPain Level: 7/10 at its worst.\nWeight: 5 lb increase since last visit.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nCV: No murmurs, gallops or rubs. Pulses are equal bilaterally.\nRESPIRATORY: Normal respiratory effort, no respiratory distress. Lungs are clear bilaterally to auscultation.\nSKIN: No rash or lesions.\nMSK: Examination of the right elbow: Moderate tenderness at the medial epicondyle. Pain with resisted pronation of the right forearm. Pain with flexion and bending the right wrist. No bruising or swelling. No discoloration or lesions.\n\nRESULTS\n\nAn x-ray of the right elbow was reviewed today. It demonstrated no evidence of any fractures. No other abnormalities are noted.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\n1. Right elbow pain, consistent with medial epicondylitis.\n2. Diabetes type 2.\n3. Hypertension.\n\nPLAN\n\nAfter reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with her regarding her current symptoms. I have explained to her that her elbow pain is consistent with medial epicondylitis and was most likely caused by overuse and damage to the tendons in her arm. I have recommended that we treat the patient conservatively. The patient will wear a sling on her right arm while she is awake to provide increased support. I advised her to ice her right elbow for 20 minutes 3 times per day. She will take ibuprofen 600 mg every 6 hours with food for 1 week. I have also advised her to hold off on creating pottery for the next 2 weeks to allow her arm to heal. If the patient continues to experience persistent elbow pain, we may consider formal physical therapy at her next visit.\n\nI have encouraged the patient to check and record her blood sugars every day. I will increase her metformin to 1000 mg twice a day. The patient and I discussed the importance of her taking her medication on a regular basis twice a day. I have also recommended that she be referred to diabetic counseling for more information on the steps she can take to manage her diabetes. I will also order a hemoglobin A1c test for a more accurate assessment of her long-term blood sugar levels.\n\nThe patient\u2019s hypertension is currently controlled with medication and exercise. I have instructed her to continue taking lisinopril 10 mg. I also encouraged her to continue with her walking routine.\n\nAll questions were answered.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nThe patient will follow up with me in 2 weeks to review the results of the hemoglobin A1c test and discuss her progress.\n</gold_response>\nCarefully review the <response> based on the <conversation> and compare it to the <gold_response> when needed.\n\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Does the note provide correct clinical information based on the conversation?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the note include all important medical details from the conversation?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the note written clearly and organized in a standard clinical format for clinicians\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

back pain i believe you have a musculoskeletal low back strain i'm going to order a low back x-ray so we'll order that and get that done as an outpatient i do n't expect to see anything significant but it's gon na tell me how those joint spaces look and if you know if we're dealing with any disk issue but that will be the start of it and i'm also gon na order some physical therapy two for two reasons to help with a little bit with the pain but also strengthen some of the muscles there in the back so those are the two things that we are gon na do now i want you to take take four hundred milligrams of ibuprofen you can take that occasionally with some tylenol when the pain gets more severe up to about three times a day i'm gon na also give you a prescription for some flexeril that's a muscle relaxant and i want you to take one of those once a day every evening but be careful if you're doing any strenuous or hazardous activities such as driving after you take those now for your diabetes my impression is that your diabetes is is under control i noticed that we do n't have n't had a a1c for almost five months so i'm also gon na order an a1c so we can find out where we are with that continue with your diet and exercise we know that's really important and then continue with your metformin i'm not gon na make any changes today but we'll go ahead and look at that once i get that results of that a1c do you have any questions for me\n[patient] yeah can i still go to the bakery\n[doctor] i would yes it's nice for you to go to the bakery but you ca n't have any donuts i'm no i you just really need to watch that intake of of anything that you might get at the at the bakery so just just be careful with those carbohydrates those sweets that you're taking as we go through your day it's occasional occasional one perfectly fine but on a routine basis we need to watch that\n[patient] right and how soon should i you know check my blood sugars i mean what's a good you know\n[doctor] yeah i that's a great question i'm really glad you asked that i would prefer that you're taking your blood pressure every morning the first thing you get up when you get up in the morning that's gon na give me a good idea and so if you can do that the first thing in the morning and keep a record of it you know i know your glucometer keeps a record of it but if you can write them down and once we get that a1c that's gon na give me a little more guidance on how to deal with your blood your diabetes\n[patient] right do you think would i need to see you know a pain doctor or you know\n[doctor] not yet let's let's get the that's a great question i may end up referring you to a a pain doctor for that low back pain but i really would like to start with some of the diagnostics first let's get an x-ray and if there is you know any question of that x-ray and the pain continues i'm gon na go ahead and maybe order a cat scan and then at that point in time we can refer you to a pain doctor if we're still having significant pain\n[patient] sounds good\n[doctor] okay thank you i'm gon na send my nursing to see you and we'll get you out the door\n[patient] thank

I explained that physical therapy can help with the pain, but also strengthen some of the muscles in the back. I explained that he needs to be careful while taking medications, such as an overuse of muscle relaxers if he is doing any strenuous or hazardous activities such as driving.\n- Medical Treatment: Low back x-ray ordered. Referral to physical therapy provided. He will take 400 mg of ibuprofen up to 3 times per day. Tylenol can be used for severe pain. Prescription for Flexeril also provided.\n\n2. Diabetes.\n- Medical Reasoning: His diabetes is currently under control.\n- Patient Education and Counseling: We discussed the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle. I encouraged him to try an avoid foods high in sugar. He asked many questions and I feel he is confident in the plan at this point.\n- Medical Treatment: Hemoglobin A1c ordered as he has not had an updated one in almost 5 months.

Initially, he experienced ankle soreness, which has since resolved, but he now reports persistent clicking in the lateral aspect of his right knee, especially during full squats and prolonged standing on one foot. He denies pain at rest but experiences discomfort when resting his foot on his heel. He has not taken much pain medication but reports that ibuprofen helps him sleep at night. He notes that activities such as gardening exacerbate his symptoms. He also has a history of multiple right toe fractures over the past ten years, with associated numbness and tingling, unrelated to this injury.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM:\nOn musculoskeletal exam, slight edema and effusion are noted in the right knee. No tenderness to palpation over the lateral knee. Full range of motion is present, with pain elicited only when the knee is pulled to the outside. A positive varus stress test indicates lateral collateral ligament strain. No pain with Lachman test. The knee is stable, and no ligamentous instability is observed. Neurovascular exam reveals palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses. No other significant findings.\n\nRESULTS:\nKnee X-ray shows no evidence of fracture or bony abnormalities.

No acute bony injury identified.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\nThe patient appears to have a lateral collateral ligament strain of the right knee. Management includes prescribing meloxicam 15 mg once daily for inflammation and pain, and referral to physical therapy to strengthen peri-knee musculature and prevent future injury. He is advised to continue icing the knee (20 minutes on, 20 minutes off, at least four times daily) and to monitor symptoms. If pain persists or worsens, an MRI may be considered for further evaluation. The patient is instructed to contact the clinic if symptoms change or worsen.

yeah yeah i heard it stepping off a curb\n[doctor] how long ago did that happen\n[patient] about two and a half weeks ago\n[doctor] two and a half weeks ago and what what knee is bothering you\n[patient] the right knee the outside of my right knee\n[doctor] the outside of your right knee\n[patient] yeah\n[doctor] okay and did you actually fall down when this happened or\n[patient] no i just sorta turned over my ankle\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] to the outside and i thought my ankle was the thing that was gon na hurt most but after the ankle soreness went away the only my knee hurt and it sort of clicks when i walk\n[doctor] and no okay so now it clicks when you walk okay does it hurt when you walk\n[patient] no unless i stand on one foot for an extended period of time like leaning my foot up against the wall\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] then i feel like it's locked and then i sort of have to ease into walking again\n[doctor] okay and what have you taken for the pain\n[patient] really nothing\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] ibuprofen but i'm not a big pill taker so i sort of sucked it up and\n[doctor] does the ibuprofen work\n[patient] at night you know during the day i'm more active so it it really does n't impact it because i just work through it but at night it does help me to settle down and sleep better\n[doctor] does your knee hurt when you're just resting and sitting there\n[patient] no when it's up it's fine when it's down on the floor with my foot flat it's fine it does hurt when i rest it on my heel\n[doctor] okay and are you able to do things like bending or things like that\n[patient] a full squat that's when i feel the most clicking like if i go all the way down to a full squat like a catcher that's when i feel the most clicking but otherwise no there is no pain it's just the clicking and i'm fearful that that's an injury of some type\n[doctor] okay alright now you said squats are you are you active are you doing like burpees going to\n[patient] no i ride the bike\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] i ride the bike i ride the bike which i'm not doing now peloton inside for the winter i do have a winter bike though\n[doctor] okay alright well i have a peloton who is your favorite instructor\n[patient] i i actually do n't have a favorite instructor i have more favorite rides\n[doctor] okay what kind of rides do you like\n[patient] i like rock music and regain music rides so whoever is doing those in a began or a medium content i'm cool with\n[doctor] i ca n't picture you as a regade person so that's interesting to know okay alright and any numbing or tingling in your foot at all\n[patient] yes but not from the knee injury i broke my foot my second toe on my right foot and i have numbness depending upon the shoe i wear\n[doctor] okay when did you break your toe\n[patient] i've broken it three times over the last ten years so it's just something that's a an annoyance but it was n't caused by this injury\n[doctor] okay so you do have some numbing and tingling but it's not new\n[patient] right correct\n[doctor] alright alright well let's just go ahead and i'm gon na go ahead and do a quick physical exam i'm gon na be calling out my exam findings i'll let you know what that means so on your musculoskeletal exam on your right knee i do appreciate some slight edema you do have a slight effusion does it hurt when i press on the outside of your knee\n[patient] no not physically\n[doctor] okay there is no pain to palpation of the right lateral knee i'm gon na be bending your knee in all sorts of positions does that hurt\n[patient] only when you pull it to the outside\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] from my my foot when you pull it to the outside that's the only time it hurts\n[doctor] okay the patient has a positive varus test there is full range of motion there is a negative lachman sign the patient does on cardiovascular exam the patient does have a palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulse okay well let's just i wan na talk a little bit about i had the nurse do an x-ray on you and i looked at the results of your knee x-ray and it does n't show any acute fracture or bony abnormality which is not surprising based on your injury so let's just talk a little bit about you know my assessment and my plan for you so i think you do have a a lateral a lateral collateral ligament strain based on your exam findings and this this type of injury essentially can be healed by itself you know i do n't think we're gon na need to refer you to surgery or anything like that i want you to go ahead and i'm gon na prescribe meloxicam fifteen milligrams once a day i do wan na go ahead and refer you to physical therapy because if we strengthen up those muscles and areas around that injury then that will make your knee stronger it help prevent future injuries are you able to ice it at all during the day now you said you working you work in sales so you said you're home\n[patient] yeah i actually i'm at home so i can ice it and i have been icing it\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] i mean twenty on twenty off at least four times a day\n[doctor] okay and so does that help at all\n[patient] it's it it makes it feel better in the morning when i first go to my desk and at the end of the day before bed you know i take ibuprofen so i do n't have swelling overnight but honestly i have a pretty decent threshold for pain so it's not good it's not changing it by much\n[doctor] okay do you feel like your symptoms are getting worse or better i think i think pretty much for the last two weeks they've remained about the same the the only time i feel like they get worse is when i exert myself doing up and down like gardening in the yard or moving pots\n[patient] and stuff outside that's the only time i felt like it got any worse but nothing to the point where it stayed worse\n[doctor] okay alright well let's go ahead and refer you to physical therapy if you're still having pain then we might have to consider an mri\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] any questions about that\n[patient] no\n[doctor] okay alright well it was very nice seeing you today call me if you need anything\n[patient] i will\n[doctor] okay bye\n[patient] bye\n</conversation>\nThe generated note will be provided in these tags:\n<response>\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:\nGregory reports injuring his right knee

The onset of his pain began 2.5 weeks ago, when he stepped off of a curb and turned over his ankle. He locates his pain to the lateral aspect of his right knee. The patient also reports clicking with ambulation. He denies any pain with ambulation unless he stands on one foot for an extended period of time. The patient also reports locking of his knee with prolonged standing. He notices pain when he is resting his foot on his heel. He denies any pain at rest and elevated, or when his foot is flat on the ground. The patient states that he is more active during the day, which does not impact his knee pain. He adds that he is able to perform a full squat without pain. The patient reports numbness and tingling in his right foot, however this is not new. The patient has been taking ibuprofen, which provides him with relief at night. He has also been icing his knee 4 times per day, which provides him with relief in the morning and at the end of the day.\n\nMEDICAL HISTORY\n\nHe states that he has fractured his 2nd toe 3 times over the last 10 years.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nThe patient works in sales. He rides a bike for exercise.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nNeurological: Positive for numbness and tingling in his toes on his right foot from prior injury.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nCV: >Palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulse.\nMSK: Examination of the right knee: Slight edema. Slight effusion. No pain with palpation of the right lateral knee. Positive varus test. Full ROM. Negative Lachman's.\n\nRESULTS\n\n4 views of the right knee were taken. These reveal no evidence of any fractures, dislocations, or bony abnormality. No other abnormalities are noted.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nRight knee lateral collateral ligament strain.\n\nPLAN\n\nAfter reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. I have explained to him that his x-rays did not reveal any acute fractures or bony abnormality. I have recommended that we treat the patient conservatively with formal physical therapy to strengthen his right knee. I have also prescribed the patient meloxicam 15 mg to treat his pain.

before here\n[patient] the i'm training for a triathlon and the back of my heel hurts typically after a workout or when i first get up in the morning it will really hurt in the back of my heel all the way up into my calf\n[doctor] okay now tell me a little bit about this triathlon training what do you are you are you running far are you tell me kind of how you work out for that today\n[patient] i i will run about ten klometers\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] in the morning at lunchtime i try to get on the bike for about forty five minutes to an hour\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] and then in the evening i go to the aquatic center and i jump in the pool and swim for about another thirty minutes to an hour\n[doctor] wow that's that's a that's an aggressive campaign to get there so really hope you get that triathlon in so you're how many days a week does this occur that you're training\n[patient] i i do that five days a week on the weekends i kinda alternate between you know a long run and a long bike do n't really do a long swim but\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] i i just swimming on those other five days and i take one day off\n[doctor] okay on your running days or when you do the running tell me a little bit about your stretching routine do you are you aggressive stretchers you do not stretch at all i know people that do both\n[patient] yeah i do n't i do n't stretch at all i do n't have time for that\n[doctor] okay and i'm assuming that with the bicycle either you do n't really work the lower legs to get them stretched out you just jump on and go correct\n[patient] yeah\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] yeah you know i you know when i first start off i go slow until i'm warmed up and then i\n[doctor] okay tell me a little bit about the pain is you said it it's after the activity but it you when you first wake up in the morning it it's it's there also\n[patient] yeah when i first get out of bed it's just it just feels really tight and almost like it's tearing and i after i been walking around for about ten or fifteen minutes it eases up a little bit but if if i ever sit down for any extended period of time and then try to get back up it's really sore again\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] or\n[doctor] no go ahead go ahead\n[patient] or after a lot of activity it'll get sore too\n[doctor] okay okay i'm sure this is impacting that ability to to really focus on your training uh as you're going with that with that type of a pain so lem me go ahead and let's let's take a look at your your and your lower extremities here and yeah okay so roll up your pants yeah okay good now does your left leg hurt at all do you get that severe pain or is it mainly on the right\n[patient] no it's mainly just on the right\n[doctor] okay okay so i'm gon na just hold your leg here and i want you to take your your foot and ankle and i want you to go ahead and just pull your your toes up towards you does that create some pain when you do that\n[patient] yeah a little bit\n[doctor] a little bit okay now i'm just gon na hold your foot up and i want you to push against me and does that hurt\n[patient] yeah that hurts a little bit too\n[doctor] yeah okay okay roll over here on my my stretcher for me and i want you to dangle your your feet over the edge and what i wan na do is i just wan na i'm gon na squeeze your left calf first and when i do that does that hurt on your left side\n[patient] no\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] no\n[doctor] and i'm gon na squeeze on the right side anything there\n[patient] no\n[doctor] okay okay well that's good your your thompson test is negative that's a really good finding and i just wan na continue pressing here on your right from your heel when i squeeze your heel does that cause significant pain at all\n[patient] yeah\n[doctor] yeah okay and if i come up a little bit further as i i run up that achilles tendon does that hurt\n[patient] that's real tender\n[doctor] yeah okay okay great not great so yeah go ahead and sit up for me so dennis my diagnosis is achilles tendinitis and it's really from overuse when we see this frequently when somebody starts to you know get in and train aggressively for an event i'm unfortunately i'm gon na have to ask you to stop training for a a week or two i know that's concerning but i really want this to heal before we move into that next phase i did n't ask you about medication but i'm assuming whatever you were doing was n't working significantly so what i'd like you to do is take some ibuprofen or advil that's the same medication and i want you to take three tablets every six hours and that's really an anti-inflammatory see if we can eliminate some of that tendinitis type pain that you're getting that inflammation around that achilles tendon i'm gon na also order a couple physical therapy visits and the reason for that is i'd like you to get some strength and stretching understanding i think it's important for you especially here at the beginning is to get some of that real stretching knowledge in and learn how to stretch those muscles before you start these activities and they are gon na help strengthen your your lower extremities also and i want you to come back to me within you know a week to ten days following your first couple physical therapy appointments so i can monitor how you're doing i see no reason for an x-ray at this point but if this continues we're gon na you know if you're still having pain ten days in significant pain without change modification of your activity then we may have to look at more aggressive treatment plans how does that sound for you\n[patient] sounds good\n[doctor] okay hey did you happen to catch that pittsburgh pang one hockey game last night\n[patient] no i i was watching the track meet\n[doctor] my gosh the the pang ones are on fire you know they beat up on new york seven to two i mean the hockey's just an amazing sport i i just do you guy do you do a lot of hockey down there in town here\n[patient] used to when i lived in detroit\n[doctor] oh\n[patient] hockey town but not so much anymore\n[doctor] no yeah detroit is a hockey town yeah the red wings okay well i'm gon na go ahead and i'll send my nurse in and go ahead and get you discharged and like i said i'd like to see you back here in seven to ten days after that first physical therapy appointment i've got a great phenomenal office staff you just call in once that gets scheduled they will get you in to that next available appointment so take care and i will talk to you later\n[patient]

got some you've got type two diabetes and that probably the reason for your ear but ulcer not healing so how you doing today what's going on\n[patient] doing pretty good except i ca n't get this ulcer to heal\n[doctor] okay how long has that wound been present\n[patient] maybe about a year\n[doctor] a year well that that's a that's a a long time so when it started i guess did you have any trauma to the foot or did was it just all of a sudden\n[patient] no trauma it just it seemed like a little blister and then i picked at it and it did get a little bit red and infected so i talked to my primary about it\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] i went on some antibiotics it seemed to get better but nothing is really making it go away\n[doctor] okay when was the last time you were on antibiotics\n[patient] it's probably been five months\n[doctor] five months alright do you remember which antibiotics you were on\n[patient] keflex\n[doctor] keflex alright so kinda does your foot hurt or is it just just the\n[patient] no pain but i do n't have much feeling in my foot\n[doctor] alright so you've got neuropathy yeah that that that makes sense with the the diabetes so have you had any other symptoms like a fever chills any drainage coming from it\n[patient] lately there has been a lot more drainage and i just feel a little more tired\n[doctor] okay alright well that that sounds good so today is thursday so what do you have for the weekend\n[patient] not too much i'll probably be walking around at the zoo on this ulcer all weekend and eating out and not doing anything my doctor wants me to do\n[doctor] no yeah i yeah i know you do have that diabetes i know your pcp probably would n't be excited about you you eating out and all that but you know hopefully we can we i can at least get your your foot a little bit better so your diabetes i know we talked a little bit earlier how is that going for you is it controlled you know what's your your blood sugars running\n[patient] yeah they are running better than they were but they are still in the two hundreds so my doctor does n't like that my last a1c was about ten\n[doctor] okay alright yeah i i you probably definitely need to get back with your pcp about that because the a1c is is pretty high and i know he probably had you on some medication and insulin and metformin and insulin just to try to to get that lower but\n[patient] yes\n[doctor] you know we are here for your foot so let's let me take a look at that so we will do a quick exam of your foot so you do n't have any fever your vitals look good so on your your right foot exam i can see here you do have a one by two centimeter two inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot so it's just proximal to the fifth mtp joint i do see some yellow slough that's present with minimal granulation tissue you have no surrounding erythema or cellulitis and there is n't any evidence of fluid collection i do n't see necrosis so there is no dead tissue around it there's no odor and i i do n't appreciate any bony exposure and does it hurt when i touch it here\n[patient] no\n[doctor] okay so we did a x-ray of your right foot before you came in and it showed no evidence of osteomyelitis that means that there is no bone infection which is really good so let me just talk a little about my assessment and plan of your your foot so you do have that diabetic foot ulcer so what i'm gon na do is i'm going to order a abi or ankle brachial index and that's just to determine your blood supply just to see if we can actually heal that wound i know it's been there for about a year which is a pretty long time and so we just need to see if we can if you do have that blood flow just in case we need to to make other goals for that foot just to depend upon that i'm also gon na do a debridement here have you had that done before of the\n[patient] yes i think so\n[doctor] okay so you know you know pretty much about that so i'm just gon na try to take off some of that dead tissue we'll do that here in the office afterwards and then i'm going to prescribe you some colaganase ointment and you could just add that to your wound once a day and cover it with a sterile dressing and we're gon na try to continue that until we see it start to shrink and hopefully you know that will work between the debridement and then the ointment did they give you at your pcp they give you a surgical shoe or have you been wearing your regular shoes\n[patient] i've just been wearing my regular shoes\n[doctor] okay so we're gon na get you a surgical shoe and i want you to to wear that and that can help you take pressure off the area because i know you said you're gon na walk around with this zoo this this weekend so i definitely do n't want you to put much pressure on it from now on and hopefully that can help it heal and so after all that i'm just gon na see you back in two weeks and we could take another look and possible do another debridement of the ulcer so do you have any questions for me\n[patient] i do n't think so\n[doctor] alright so i'll see you back in two weeks and i hope you have fun at the zoo this weekend\n[patient] thank

you're here for follow-up after an interior stemi where we had to put in another stent right so like how are you doing\n[patient] well i mean it was a real shock for me i thought everything was fine after my last heart attack and then i just started having this horrible chest pain and it would n't go away so i went to the emergency room and yeah they told me i needed another stent\n[doctor] wow so you were experiencing similar symptoms similar to what you had the first time\n[patient] yeah yeah it was yeah it was bad it was just like the last time\n[doctor] okay have you had any chest pain or shortness of breath\n[patient] no i think i saw you about six months ago and and i was doing fine\n[doctor] okay have you been able to like exercise at all since since you last saw me\n[patient] yeah you know i walk my dog everyday and you know we go like a mile and a half or two miles\n[doctor] awesome okay yeah you know because like fall is setting in like are you excited\n[patient] yeah yeah i'm excited\n[doctor] do you have any like plans for the holiday\n[patient] no mm-hmm no i'm just you know looking forward to seeing family and having some nice weather and yeah\n[doctor] okay so i do wan na ask i know that you have a history of coronary artery disease hypertension and diabetes so i wan na get an idea of like where you stand with those have you been experiencing any kind of leg swelling\n[patient] i have noticed that my legs are a little swollen since they sent me home from the hospital\n[doctor] okay are you able to lie flat at night when you sleep\n[patient] yeah i mean i always use a couple of pillows you know i maybe i've had to sit up a little bit more but i mean for the most part i think it's pretty normal\n[doctor] okay and then have you been able to afford your medications and are you taking them like your like you were prescribed\n[patient] yeah i'm able to afford afford them i have good insurance i am taking them they told me it's really important to take them so so yeah\n[doctor] yeah that's very accurate you know like there are huge consequences to not taking them so if you are noticing any problems please please please please let us know how about your diet are you watching your salt intake\n[patient] i mean i'm not i i i have n't really adjusted i mean i tried to watch it after the last heart attack and now you know i i've kind of been less strict with my diet but i'll have to go back to watching the salt intake\n[doctor] mm-hmm\n[patient] i love pizza it's my favorite food\n[doctor] yeah\n[patient] my tries are probably my second favorite food\n[doctor] what are you for her toppings on pizza\n[patient] pepperoni occasionally vegetables\n[doctor] mm-hmm alright but you know that pepperoni is pretty high in salt on top of a cheesy pizza right\n[patient] i know i know i'm gon na work on it\n[doctor] okay so we are we are gon na have to negotiate some of these diet things and then especially since you have diabetes like have you been managing that well\n[patient] my i've been watching my sugars yep because i do n't wan na go on insulin so i'm taking that metformin that's why i've been walking my dog i'm trying to stay active\n[doctor] okay okay so you know maybe this is just a situation of like where we are on the right path but probably need to step up a few things okay\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] alright so i do want to do a quick physical exam so you are aware i'm going to be calling out my findings as i run through it alright\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] alright so your vital signs look good you know so i'm glad that it looks like you're tolerating your medication pretty well on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any jugular venous distention so and then on top of that i'm not i do n't appreciate any carotid bruits so i'm not feeling anything like too concerning on your heart exam though there is a three over six systolic ejection murmur heard at the that i'm hearing at the left base that's not like a huge deal especially considering like what you've been through already in terms of the hospital but it is something that i wan na know in your chart when i listen to you your lungs your lungs are clear over here with your extremities i do notice you know some lower lower edema swelling sorry some lower swelling edema lower limb edema and it it is pitting one plus on your right radial artery the cath site is clean dry and intact without hematoma and i also your right radial artery pulses are palpable so i did review the results of your ekg and they show a normal sinus rhythm and a good r wave progression and a a evolutionary changes that are anticipated after a stemi one of the reasons though that we had you come in is that we noticed on your echo there is a reduced ejection fraction of thirty five percent we are a little bit concerned about that so let's talk about my assessment and plan for you your primary and like first diagnosis is gon na be coronary artery disease right you already have a history of that but you know we're gon na do some things to make we're gon na continue to evaluate that over time i want you to continue your aspirin eighty one milligrams daily and your brilinta ninety milligrams twice daily i wan na continue you on a high dose statin called lipitor and you're gon na be taking that eighty milligrams a day and we're gon na continue you on your toprol and that's gon na be fifty milligrams daily i am gon na refer you to cardiac rehab so we can get you some education and give you some confidence to get back to exercising regularly i know it was kinda scary to have such an episode but i promise like most of the patients i have love cardiac rehab and i think you'll do pretty well for your second diagnosis we have newly you have newly reduced left ventricular dysfunction and moderate mitral regurgitation what i think is like what that means is that you're you're pumping like the way that your heart is pumping is a bit concerning but i think like given your history that it will improve over time they got you into the cath lab pretty quickly so i think that the muscle is just kinda like stunned like surprised and since you're compliant with your meds i think you will recover we are gon na continue you on your lisinopril twenty milligrams daily however considering that you are retaining fluid i think that your third diagnosis is like we are crossing into acute heart failure i'm gon na prescribe something called a diuretic it's called lasix and i do want to we need to take that forty milligrams once a day i wan na add aldactone twelve . five milligrams daily and i need you to get labs finally we will repeat another echo in about two months last but not least there is the hypertension your blood pressure seems fine i think with the aldactone that you'll tolerate that pretty well but we do want to maybe get you into some nutrition counseling to consider like what other diet options might be available to you maybe suggestions of things that you have n't thought about like cutting out meat especially any kind of preserved meat like pepperoni but maybe finding you some alternatives how does that sound\n[patient] that sounds good yeah so i'm yeah as long as you tell me i'm gon na get better i believe you\n[doctor] yes yeah i i strongly believe this is our best course of action and that you will get better given enough time i i see that you are making efforts i'm really glad that you are out there walking and that you're cognizant of your diet and willing to make changes we will just you know monitor it over time okay\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] alright thank you\n</conversation>\nThe generated note will be provided in these tags:\n<response>\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:\nJulia is a

She manages her diabetes with metformin and monitors her blood sugars, aiming to avoid insulin.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM:\nVital signs are within normal limits. Neck exam shows no jugular venous distention; carotid arteries are clear with no bruits. Cardiac exam reveals a systolic ejection murmur (3/6) at the left base; no jugular venous distention or abnormal heart sounds noted. Lung auscultation is clear. Extremities show pitting edema (1+) in the lower limbs, more prominent on the right. The cath site is clean, dry, and intact. Radial pulses are palpable bilaterally. EKG demonstrates normal sinus rhythm with appropriate R wave progression. Echocardiogram shows a reduced ejection fraction of 35% and moderate mitral regurgitation.\n\nRESULTS:\n- EKG: Normal sinus rhythm, normal R wave progression\n- Echocardiogram: EF 35%, moderate mitral regurgitation\n- Physical exam: No jugular venous distention, no carotid bruits, systolic murmur at left base, bilateral lower limb pitting edema\n- Labs: Pending (to be obtained, including renal function and electrolytes)\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\n1. Coronary artery disease with recent stent placement and ongoing management:\n   - Continue aspirin 81 mg daily\n   - Continue Brilinta 90 mg twice daily\n   - Continue high-dose atorvastatin 80 mg daily\n   - Continue toprol (metoprolol) 50 mg daily\n   - Refer for cardiac rehabilitation to improve exercise confidence and education\n\n2. Left ventricular systolic dysfunction (EF 35%) and moderate mitral regurgitation:\n   - Continue lisinopril 20 mg daily\n   - Monitor for improvement; repeat echocardiogram in 2 months\n\n3. Heart failure with fluid retention:\n   - Initiate diuretics: Lasix 40 mg daily and aldactone (spironolactone) 12.5 mg daily\n   - Monitor renal function and electrolytes\n\n4. Hypertension:\n   - Blood pressure currently controlled\n   - Continue current antihypertensive regimen\n   - Recommend dietary counseling to reduce salt intake, especially processed meats and high-salt foods\n\nFollow-up:\n- Monitor clinical status, edema, and medication adherence\n- Labs to be obtained to assess renal function and electrolytes\n- Repeat echocardiogram in 2 months to evaluate cardiac function\n- Continue lifestyle modifications and dietary counseling\n</response>\nThe reference note will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nCHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nFollow up status post inferior STEMI.\n\nSURGICAL HISTORY\n\nRCA stent 2018\n\nMEDICATIONS\n\naspirin 81 mg daily\nBrilinta 90 mg twice daily\nLipitor 80 mg daily\nToprol 50 mg daily\nlisinopril 20 mg daily\nmetformin\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nCardiovascular: Denies chest pain.\nRespiratory: Denies shortness of breath.\nMusculoskeletal: Reports bilateral leg swelling.\n\nVITALS\n\nWithin normal limits\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nNeck\n- General Examination: No jugular venous distention.\n\nRespiratory\n- Auscultation of Lungs: Clear bilaterally.\n\nCardiovascular\n- Auscultation of Heart: No carotid bruits. A 3/6 systolic ejection murmur is heard at the left base.\n- Examination: Right radial artery cath site is clean, dry, and intact without hematoma. Radial artery pulses are palpable.\n\nMusculoskeletal\n- Examination: Bilateral lower limb edema. Pitting 1+.\n\nRESULTS\n\nEKG is reviewed and demonstrates a normal sinus rhythm. Good R wave progression. Evolutionary changes that are anticipated after a STEMI.\n\nEchocardiogram is reviewed and demonstrates a reduced ejection fraction of 35%.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN\n\n1. Coronary artery disease.\n- Medical Reasoning: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease that we will continue to monitor.\n- Medical Treatment: She will continue aspirin 81 mg daily and Brilinta 90 mg twice daily. She will continue Lipitor 80 mg a day and Toprol 50 mg daily. I am going to refer her to cardiac rehab for education and to gain confidence to resume exercising regularly.\n\n2. Newly reduced left ventricular dysfunction and moderate mitral regurgitation.\n- Medical Reasoning: A recent echocardiogram revealed a reduced ejection fraction of 35%. She was able to be treated in the cath lab in a timely manner, so I think that the muscle is just stunned. Given her history. it will improve over time.\n- Patient Education and Counseling: I advised the patient that she will recover since she is compliant with her medications.\n- Medical Treatment: Continue lisinopril 20 mg daily.\n\n3. Acute heart failure.\n- Medical Reasoning: The patient is retaining fluid.\n- Medical Treatment: I am going to prescribe Lasix 40 mg once a day. I want to add Aldactone 12.5 mg daily. I will order lab work. We will obtain a repeat echo in approximately 2 months.\n\n4. Hypertension.\n- Medical Reasoning: Blood pressure is well controlled. She will tolerate the Aldactone well.\n- Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged the patient to continue exercising and to be cognizant of her diet. I explained that there are healthier alternatives available to reduce the amount of preserved meats she consumes.\n- Medical Treatment: Continue lisinopril 20 mg daily. The patient received a referral to nutrition counseling to consider what other diet options might be available to her.\n\n5. Type 2 diabetes.\n- Medical Reasoning: Stable.\n- Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged the patient to continue monitoring her blood glucose levels.\n- Medical Treatment: Continue metformin as prescribed.\n\nPatient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nThe patient will follow up as instructed.\n</gold_response>\nCarefully review the <response> based on the <conversation> and compare it to the <gold_response> when needed.\n\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Does the note provide correct clinical information based on the conversation?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the note include all important medical details from the conversation?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the note written clearly and organized in a standard clinical format for clinicians\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

these tags:\n<conversation>\nDoctor-patient dialogue:\n\n[doctor] hey jose how are you doing it's been about you know three or four months since i last saw you what's going on\n[patient] i'm doing okay i i guess the medications are helping i'm concerned about all the medications i'm taking but i think i'm doing okay\n[doctor] yeah yeah you are on a fair amount of medications you know we do have you on those medications because you did have a heart attack about six months ago they put that that stent into your left anterior descending artery and so that's a major artery on the left side of your heart and so we need to keep those stents open and and kinda help your heart heal so it is gon na be very important for you to continue on those medications so you're still taking your aspirin and are you still taking the brilinta\n[patient] yes and and fish oil\n[doctor] and fish oil okay good now how are you doing with the crestor i know that that's you know that's the statin that's the cholesterol medication you were concerned that it might cause you to have some muscle aches are you taking that\n[patient] i i think i'm doing good but i i am i feel like i i when i i guess the only complaint that i have is ever since i i do n't know if this is the heart attack or if this this is the the medication but when i stand up real fast i get really dizzy\n[doctor] you get you get dizzy okay yeah you know we do have you on a what we call a beta-blocker metoprolol i think your dose is fifty milligrams once a day and you know sometimes it takes a little bit for your body to adjust to that but yes if you stand up too quickly it can cause you to be a little dizzy so\n[patient] okay okay that makes sense okay that's good to know because i did n't know what what what the problem was so can i ask you a question regarding the stents\n[doctor] yep\n[patient] how long do i have to have that in there\n[doctor] so the stents are permanent we do n't we do n't remove them so yep so that's why it's gon na be super important for you you know you're gon na be on aspirin for the rest of your life and then i'm gon na keep you on that brilinta for another six months that's gon na help prevent the that stent from clogging\n[patient] okay okay do i need to ever replace the stents then\n[doctor] no i mean every so often the stents can become narrowed again but you know that's why you're seeing me your cardiologist so that i can follow you for that now if you start to have symptoms again of any chest pain like you had before or any shortness of breath when you start to exert yourself i want you to tell me and we might have to go ahead and send you for further testing to make sure that those stents are okay but typically if you continue to take the medication watch your diet that type of thing your stents will will stay open for a long time\n[patient] okay alright that sounds good you know i have n't i had a i had i know you asked me to follow up with the dietitian because i had diabetes as well which probably contributed to my heart attack\n[doctor] yeah\n[patient] i may need a new order i do n't i i forgot who i was supposed to talk to\n[doctor] okay that's okay yeah i certainly can help you with that now managing your diabetes is also going to play an important role in your coronary artery disease which it sounds like you already know that which is really good so i will put in another referral for diabetic education for you how are you doing watching your sweets i know that you know you do have an afinity for those chocolate chip cookies\n[patient] it's okay my a1c was n't where i wanted but my glucose is coming in in about one thirty\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] fasting\n[doctor] okay what was the what was the a1c the hemoglobin a1c if you do n't mind me asking\n[patient] i thought it was close to sixty\n[doctor] okay yeah that's really high so we want it to be about six so you you do have some work to do with your diet\n[patient] yeah yeah so okay so i know you asked me to do a blood test so i did that i was wondering if you got the results\n[doctor] i did you know i looked at the results of your kidney function that's what we call your creatinine just because you had some contrast dye and sometimes contrast dye can impact the kidneys and your kidney function is stable which is great when was the last time you saw your nephrologist\n[patient] oh\n[doctor] that's your kidney doctor\n[patient] i'm a bad i'm a bad patient so probably a year ago\n[doctor] okay you know you do have the stage three ckd so that's the the stage three kidney disease so it is gon na be important for you to follow up with your nephrologist just to make sure that everything is okay now i did check your kidney function and and it was fine but are you staying away from things like motrin and advil\n[patient] right yeah that's i threw all of those out\n[doctor] okay good okay perfect now i know that you're from the west coast are you super excited that la one the super bowl or are you more of a san francisco forty nine or span\n[patient] i'm a more of a san francisco fan\n[doctor] so do you like jimmy g do you think he can beat erin rogers again\n[patient] okay we'll see we'll see what happens but i'm pretty flexible when he comes to you know that is but one thing that since i ca n't take motrin what pain killer can i take for headaches\n[doctor] you can take tylenol\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] yeah\n[patient] alright that sounds good\n[doctor] yeah\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] this is i i do n't think i have any other question the only thing i'm gon na need is a i need some refills on my medications\n[doctor] yeah i can do that but i do wan na just do a physical exam on you okay so and looking here at your vital signs here you know your your vital signs look quite good you know your blood pressure is what right where it should be it's about one twenty seven over eighty which is great so you're doing a good job taking your metoprolol now in terms of on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any jugular venous distention or carotid bruits on your heart exam i do appreciate a slight three out of six systolic ejection murmur heard at the left base and on your lower extremity exam i do appreciate some one plus nonpitting edema now what does that mean what does that mean jose so all of that means is that i do hear a little heart murmur on your heart which i've heard before in the past and it does n't it does n't look like you're retaining any fluid which is good but you do have a little puffiness in your legs which sometimes some of the medications can cause\n[patient] yeah i do have that\n[doctor] so let's just go over a little bit about my assessment and and plan for you going forward so for your first problem of your coronary artery disease i think you're doing really well i wan na go ahead and refer you for cardiac rehab just so that you can be more active and have some confidence in in exercising again okay and i am gon na go ahead and refill your metoprolol your crestor forty milligrams once a day as well as the aspirin okay i do n't think we need to proceed with a a stress test or anything at this time but you know to let me know if you have any symptoms okay\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] okay for your\n[patient] sounds really good\n[doctor] good for your second problem of your stage three chronic kidney disease i am gon na reach out to doctor miller and make an appointment for you to be seen just because again i think it's important for you to follow up with your nephrologist okay\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] and then for your third problem of your diabetes i am gon na go ahead and order another hemoglobin a1c and i'm gon na put that referral in for the dietitian to give you some dietary education and i'm gon na go ahead and talk with your primary care physician about your your insulin regimen okay\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] any questions\n[patient] yeah you know i've been kinda down ever since i had my heart attack is there any medication that i could take to make me feel a little bit less sad\n[doctor] yeah i mean are you having any thoughts of of harming yourself or harming others\n[patient] no no i just feel kinda down\n[doctor] you feel kinda down what's your\n[patient] life sucks\n[doctor] what well i do n't think so what what's your support system like\n[patient] you know i i live with my dog and that's it so it's kind of you know lonely\n[doctor] okay alright well would you be interested in in like a referral to psychiatry or something like that so that you have someone to talk to about some of of issues because medication can help but i do i think it's important to have you know talk some of these things out\n[patient] okay yeah you know i'll give that a try i mean i'm retiring i got plenty of time\n[doctor] okay so why do n't we go ahead and i'm gon na place a referral to psychiatry for you know you know difficulty adjusting after having a heart attack maybe some some mild depression okay does that sound okay okay\n[patient] yeah that sounds really good thank you\n[doctor] okay you're welcome anything else\n[patient] so you will do the medication refill do i so that's automatic\n[doctor] yep i'm gon na put them into the computer and and whatever pharmacy you want yep mm-hmm\n[patient] okay alright sounds great thank you\n[doctor] okay you're welcome i'll be in touch bye\n[patient] okay alright bye-bye\n</conversation>\nThe generated note will be provided in these

Coronary artery disease.\n- Medical Reasoning: The patient is doing very well and has been compliant with all medications. A slight 3/6 ejection murmur was heard on exam, however, this is stable and has been present in the past. He is experiencing 1+ non-pitting edema, but this seems to be medication related.\n\n- Patient Education and Counseling: Patient was advised that his stents will remain in place permanently and that they typically do not require replacement. We discussed it is common to experience dizziness when standing quickly and that this should resolve once he is adjusted to his medications. We also discussed that cardiac rehab will be beneficial in helping him become more active and confident with exercising. He was advised to watch for symptoms such as chest pain or shortness of breath on exertion as this would need further testing such as a stress test.\n- Medical Treatment: Referral to cardiac rehab was provided. A refill for metoprolol 50 mg once a day and Crestor 40 mg once a day was also provided. He is also advised to continue aspirin daily long term as well as Brilinta for the next 6 months.\n\n2. Stage 3 chronic kidney disease.\n- Medical Reasoning: Patient's most recent creatinine levels are stable.\n- Patient Education and Counseling: We discussed the importance of following up with nephrology.\n- Medical Treatment: He will follow up with his nephrologist, Dr. Miller.\n\n3. Diabetes.\n- Medical Reasoning: Patient reports most recent hemoglobin A1c was 16.\n- Patient Education and Counseling: We discussed the importance of diabetes management and how plays an important role in his coronary artery disease. He was advised that his hemoglobin A1c goal will be 6.\n- Medical Treatment: Repeat hemoglobin A1c was ordered today. A dietitian referral for diabetes education was also provided. We will contact his primary care physician regarding his insulin regimen.\n\n4. Mild depression:\n- Medical Reasoning: Patient reports feeling depressed and having a hard time adjusting since having his heart attack. He mentions he is also lonely and does not have a support system.\n- Medical Treatment: Referral to psychiatry was provided today.\n\nPatient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.\n\n</gold_response>\nCarefully review the <response> based on the <conversation> and compare it to the <gold_response> when needed.\n\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Does the note provide correct clinical information based on the conversation?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the note include all important medical details from the conversation?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the note written clearly and organized in a standard clinical format for clinicians\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

    "predicted_text": "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:\nBarbara, a 31-year-old female with a history of type 2 diabetes and asthma, presents with a one-week history of gradually worsening abdominal pain. She reports the pain is located in both sides of the upper abdomen and increases with physical activity such as jogging. She also experiences intermittent nausea (about three episodes) and vomiting (a few times) over the past week. She notes increased coffee intake last week, which she suspects may have contributed to her symptoms, and has recently reduced her coffee consumption. She denies fever. She reports eating spicy foods lately, which she believes may worsen her gastritis.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM:\nVital signs are not specified. Physical exam reveals a generally unremarkable cardiovascular and lung exam, with a grade 3 systolic ejection murmur unchanged from prior.

abdominal pain so barbara tell me a little more about your abdominal pain what's been going on\n[patient] so i've been having this pain for the past one week and as you know i have a longstanding history of diabetes and i guess i've been drinking too much coffee lately i do n't know if that triggered my gastritis so\n[doctor] yeah\n[patient] i think it's been but lately\n[doctor] okay alright and so is it increasing in severity would you say or staying about the same or what\n[patient] it's gradually increasing for sure\n[doctor] okay alright and along with the pain have you had any nausea or vomiting or diarrhea\n[patient] nausea and vomiting is on and off\n[doctor] hmmm\n[patient] so i would say i've experienced nausea for about like three times in the past week\n[doctor] okay okay and and so and you vomited how many times\n[patient] a couple of times\n[doctor] okay alright been drinking a lot of coffee you said too uh is that is that starbucks i love those nitrocolbrus and starbucks we ever had those those are incredible\n[patient] yeah\n[doctor] that's\n[patient] and the venti\n[doctor] yeah the for sure you got ta go venti on that you really have to coax them into it though they wo n't even give you it's it's like you need a license to get a venti on that that nitro it's so strong so that's my achilles heel i tell you but okay so you think that might have you think maybe coffee contributed to your abdominal pain uh you you you you've been drinking more coffee and maybe that's related as you're thinking\n[patient] yeah i think so because i started last week and towards the end of last week my coffee intake was pretty bad so i've been controlling myself this week and you know i i probably just had one cup\n[doctor] okay yeah okay and so is the pain in your upper abdomen or where in your abdomen is it\n[patient] it's on both the sides of my upper abdomen\n[doctor] hmmm okay\n[patient] so i it also increases when i work out like if i wan na jog or like go for a run my abdominal pain just like spikes you know so i have to take it easy\n[doctor] okay alright understood you've not had any fever with that pain have you\n[patient] no i have n't\n[doctor] okay alright and so how about your diabetes how's your diabetes been doing how your blood sugars been what low one hundreds two hundreds where where is it\n[patient] i think it's been under control it's eight hundred so\n[doctor] okay good and you're still taking the metformin five hundred milligrams once a day right no actually it looks like last visit we increased that to five hundred milligrams twice per day is that correct\n[patient] yes that's probably helping me keeping it under control so\n[doctor] okay good good and then for your asthma have you had any recent asthma attacks and are you still taking the flovent twice a day and albuterol as needed for wheezing\n[patient] yes but sometimes i forget you know i have n't had any asthma attacks lately so i just figured i could decrease\n[doctor] yep okay\n[patient] i think that's a good decision though\n[doctor] yeah well better to stay on the flovent daily and then just use the albuterol if you need it but if you stay on the flovent daily it will decrease the frequency of those attacks so yeah alright well let's go ahead and examine you okay so on your physical exam it's pretty normal for the most part unremarkable but i i'll i'll say on your on your heart exam you do still have a grade three out of six systolic ejection murmur that's unchanged from your prior exam and and i'm not worried about that we're kinda watching that but it just means i hear some heart sounds when your valves are moving and otherwise normal heart exam for your abdominal exam you do have mild tenderness in the epigastrium of your abdomen your abdomen's otherwise soft there's no tenderness in the right lower quadrant whatsoever and there is no significant tenderness in the right upper quadrant so i think you know that's right where your stomach is in the upper abdomen so i think that you know that may be you may be right this could be some gastritis so so then otherwise on your exam on your lung exam you do have some mild end expiratory wheezes very faint and otherwise normal lung exam with excellent air movement and otherwise pretty normal physical exam so let's talk about your my assessment and your plan here so first of all for the first problem of the abdominal pain i do think that you have acute gastritis and i think this is probably related to the caffeine intake and i i know that you've had a a moderately heavy history of alcohol use too so i want you to cut back on the alcohol as well you know keep that down to a dull roller like maybe keep that less than two or three drinks a week would be great and then also cut back on the caffeine and that should help and i'm going to write you a prescription for zantac as well as we need and so i'll write you a prescription you can take that twice a day that should help with the acid in your stomach and the pain and then i'm going to check a urinalysis a urine pregnancy test a cbc a comprehensive metabolic panel as well and we'll see what those results show just to be sure it's nothing else going on and then for your second problem of diabetes type two let's continue you on the metformin but i wan na adjust the dose slightly i'm gon na increase the morning dose to one thousand milligrams and the evening dose we can keep at five hundred so we'll go metformin one thousand milligrams in the morning and five hundred milligrams in the evening please continue to check your blood sugars let me know what they are when you come back you know we just keep track of those and then we'll see you back in four weeks by the way i wan na have you follow up with me in four weeks and for your third problem of asthma let's continue you on the flovent that seems to be doing pretty well continue to take that daily and then also albuterol as needed so how does that sound for a plan any other questions comments suggestions\n[patient] that sounds good and i also feel like i'm eating been eating a lot of spicy food\n[doctor] hmmm\n[patient] lately that could be contributing towards my gastritis so i'm gon na cut back on that as well\n[doctor] okay yeah i'd also recommend while this is hurting you definitely cut back on the spices the spicy food easier said than done sometimes i know but yep yep alright sounds good well listen i'll see you back in four weeks give me a holler if if you have any questions or anything else in the meantime\n[patient] i will\n[doctor] alright you take care sure you got\n</conversation>\nThe generated note will be provided in these tags:\n<response>\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:\nBarbara, a 31-year-old female with a history of type 2 diabetes and asthma, presents with a one-week history of gradually worsening abdominal pain.

recently i've been having some numbness and tingling in my right hand\n[doctor] okay how long has that been going on\n[patient] i do n't know probably on and off for six months but over the last month or so it's been a little more persistent\n[doctor] okay okay and when does that numbness and tingling do you get a lot of pain with it first let me ask that question\n[patient] some pain\n[doctor] some pain\n[patient] mostly when i'm actually typing on the keyboard is when i experience the pain\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] but the numbness and tingling is all the time now\n[doctor] okay and when you get this pain what makes it better is it stopping and just resting for a while or do you take medications or try other\n[patient] i've been taking ibuprofen so ibuprofen and seem like not typing on the keyboard helps the most\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] the other thing that makes it hurt is my mouse\n[doctor] your mouth okay\n[patient] wow\n[doctor] yeah when you're moving that around okay\n[patient] yeah\n[doctor] does this pain ever wake you up in the middle of the night or the pain or the tingling\n[patient] no\n[doctor] no okay\n[patient] not affecting my sleep hmmm\n[doctor] okay so and you're using motrin for for ibuprofen for for the pain well let me go ahead and take a take a look here at your is it both hands or just your right hand\n[patient] mostly my right hand\n[doctor] mostly your right hand okay so let's go ahead and take a look at that right hand when i bend your wrist does that cause any pain\n[patient] yes\n[doctor] it does okay and so you do have some pain on extension and if you pull your your hand wrist up towards you does that cause the pain also\n[patient] yes\n[doctor] yeah okay so you do have pain on flexion and extension and when i touch the fingertips here now you said you had some numbness in your thumb and your index finger and a little bit in your your middle finger the other two fingers they feel okay or do you think that there is different than the other hand\n[patient] yeah for some reason it really is just that the thumb the pointer in the middle finger that i experience the most symptoms with\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] not why that is\n[doctor] okay so i i want you to grip my hands here and just squeeze tight okay so you do have a a little bit of a less grip strength on the right and that's typical that we would see with this type of pain and and numbness that you have going on now i want you to turn your arm over for me and i'm gon na touch on or tap on the inside of your wrist or or forearm and when i do that i can see your face you're grimacing so that that that must cause that shooting pain yeah okay so you do have a positive tinel's sign so in alexis what i think is going on is that you have a a carpal tunnel syndrome and we see that frequent\n[patient] i was afraid of\n[doctor] yeah you see this frequently but people who are doing data entry spend a lot of time on keyboards or you know some a lotta manufacturing people who do a repetitive procedure again and again will get that type of pain so here is my plan i'd like to put you in a splint and it's it's it's kind of a wrist splint i would like you to wear that at night that will help with that i want you to continue with the ibuprofens but i would like you to go up to six hundred milligrams four times a day and\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] we're gon na do that now i am going to order some a a outpatient test called an emg where we look at that nerve conduction study in that wrist and that's really what's happening here is you've got some thickening in the the in the wrist and the the the membranes of the wrist that are just pressing down and just compressing some of those nerves any other questions for me for now if that test comes back positive and we'll talk about that later on your next visit if it comes back positive we may have to do we're gon na stick with conservative treatment first but we may consider some surgery where i can go in and release that impingement on your nerves through your wrist it's a simple outpatient procedure and then i think you would feel better how does that sound\n[patient] that sounds like a good plan i was hoping maybe i could get some relief with some therapy rather than having to go to surgery so i like that plan very much\n[doctor] yeah we'll start with the the wrist splint and once i get the nerve conduction studies that will give me another idea whether or not i need to send you some physical therapy in addition or if we need to go directly to surgery but that will all hinge on that nerve conduction test do you so do you have any further questions\n[patient] no that's great thank you so much\n[doctor] thank you very

was a one fifty over seven over ninety which is pretty high today i see you're on twenty of lisinopril have you been taking that daily\n[patient] yes\n[doctor] okay so maybe you just have a little little white coat syndrome i know i have that myself and even though i'm a physician i i still do n't like to go to the doctor so i definitely understand how about your diet i know we talked a little bit about that before and you said kinda during the pandemic you fell off a little bit how you been doing that have you been lowering your salt intake\n[patient] yeah but i only eat low salt items avoid adding salt to food kind of the whole whole family follows like a you know like a mediterranean diet\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] we try to be pretty good about it\n[doctor] okay yeah that's good that that's that's definitely good yeah i know a lot of people during the pandemic it was you know sitting at home and and eating more than we should but that's i'm very happy that you've been compliant and you have that low salt diet so let's talk about your diabetes i think you see here on on five hundred of metformin are you taking that as well daily\n[patient] yes\n[doctor] okay and your blood sugars how have they been\n[patient] since i do n't take insulin i do n't check it everyday when i have checked it it's usually running somewhere between eighty to a hundred\n[doctor] okay yeah that's that's really good yeah so i that's that's pretty good so what we're gon na do we're gon na get a a1c just to see you know that range and it's possibility we can we can you know lower that metformin dosage but we will do that after your visit then we will take a look at that so lem me go ahead and will do that quick exam of your elbow but first i want to make sure you're not having any chest pain or anything like that\n[patient] no\n[doctor] no belly pain\n[patient] no\n[doctor] alright so listen to your lungs so your lungs are clear bilaterally listen to your heart so your heart exam you do still have that grade two out of six systolic ejection murmur but we know it about that before so let me take a look at your elbow so when i press right here on the back of your elbow is that painful\n[patient] yes\n[doctor] alright so when i have you you you flex and extend it it's painful does that does that hurt\n[patient] yes it does\n[doctor] alright so your right elbow exam shows you have pain to palpation of the olecranon area of the posterior elbow you do have mild pain with flexion and extension but you do have also normal range of motion at that elbow so we we did do an x-ray before you came in and luckily nothing's broken no fracture no bony abnormality so it's a normal x-ray which is really good so let me just talk to you a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so you have a elbow contusion i believe your son did hit you with the lacrosse stick and it caused that that pain i see some swelling little inflammation there as well you have a little bit of a bruise i think that's that's what happened so for that i know you're having some pain i'm gon na prescribe you eight hundred milligrams of ibuprofen you can take that twice a day and that should help with some of that swelling and pain i also want you to ice it three times a day for twenty minutes at a time that should also help with the swelling and pain and just for the time being for the next couple of weeks just you know maybe you know not play lacrosse with your son just to help that heal then you can get back on on the field so for your your high blood pressure we're just gon na keep you on the hypertension we'll just keep you on that twenty milligrams of lisinopril looks like you're doing great with that and your diet and then for your diabetes we will keep you on the five hundred milligrams of metformin and we will also get a a1c just to check your levels and see if we do need to adjust the medication in the future alright so do you have any questions for me\n[patient] no sounds good\n[doctor] alright so we will see you next time and my nurse will be in with those prescriptions\n[patient] alright thank you\n</conversation>\nThe generated note will be provided in these tags:\n<response>\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:\nPhilip presents with right elbow pain following a lacrosse game with his children approximately one week ago. The pain is localized at the posterior tip of the elbow (olecranon), described as sharp and radiating down the forearm. The pain worsens with movement, including flexion and extension. He reports a recent history of possible trauma from his son checking him with a stick, but no fall or direct blow was recalled. He attempted to manage the pain with ibuprofen, which provided some relief.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM:\nVital signs: BP 150/90 mm Hg; otherwise stable. The patient is on lisinopril and metformin with good compliance. Cardiac exam reveals a grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur. Lung auscultation is clear bilaterally. Elbow examination shows tenderness to palpation over the olecranon, pain with flexion and extension, and mild swelling. Range of motion is preserved. No deformity or bony abnormalities noted. No chest or abdominal pain reported.\n\nRESULTS:\nX-ray of the right elbow was performed prior to the visit, showing no fractures or bony abnormalities. Blood pressure remains elevated but may be influenced by white coat syndrome. Blood glucose levels are generally well-controlled, with self-monitored readings between 80-100 mg/dL. An upcoming A1c test will be performed to assess long-term glycemic control.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\n1. Right elbow contusion likely due to trauma from lacrosse stick, with associated mild inflammation and pain. Prescribed ibuprofen 800 mg twice daily and advised to ice the elbow three times daily for 20 minutes. Recommended to avoid playing lacrosse temporarily to facilitate healing.\n2. Hypertension: Continue current lisinopril 20 mg daily; monitor blood pressure regularly.\n3. Diabetes: Continue metformin 500 mg daily; upcoming A1c to evaluate glycemic control and consider medication adjustments if necessary.\n4.

Right elbow contusion.\n- Medical Reasoning: The patient sustained an injury to his elbow when his son struck him with a lacrosse stick. His x-ray and exam findings are consistent with an elbow contusion.\n- Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged the patient to avoid playing lacrosse for the next couple of weeks, just until his elbow heals. After that, he should be fine to continue playing normally.\n- Medical Treatment: I'm going to prescribe him ibuprofen 800 mg twice daily to help with some of the pain and swelling. He should also ice the area in 20-minute intervals 3 times per day to further reduce his symptoms.\n\n2. Hypertension.\n- Medical Reasoning: This appears to be well-controlled with dietary modifications and lisinopril.\n- Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged him to keep up with his dietary modifications.\n- Medical Treatment: We will keep him on lisinopril 20 mg daily.\n\n3. Diabetes.\n- Medical Reasoning: This appears to be well controlled at this time.\n- Medical Treatment: We will keep him on metformin 500 mg and order a hemoglobin A1c to evaluate any need for medication adjustments.\n\nPatient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.\n</gold_response>\nCarefully review the <response> based on the <conversation> and compare it to the <gold_response> when needed.\n\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Does the note provide correct clinical information based on the conversation?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the note include all important medical details from the conversation?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the note written clearly and organized in a standard clinical format for clinicians\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

The onset of his pain began yesterday after he slipped and fell on the ice while taking out the trash. He states that he was unable to ambulate at the time of injury and that a friend had to help him up. He then proceeded to ice and elevate his ankle throughout the night. His pain has since improved and he is able to bear more weight on his right ankle, however he is still limping. He denies experiencing any numbness to his right foot. In addition to ice and elevation he has been taking ibuprofen for his pain, which has provided some relief. He does not recall any other previous injury to his right ankle.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nPatient reports that he is very active and enjoys playing soccer. He currently plays for the community soccer league.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nMusculoskeletal: Reports right ankle pain.\n\nVITALS\n\nVitals signs look good today.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nCV: Mild edema\nNEURO: Normal sensation.\nMSK: Examination of the right ankle: Ecchymosis is present.

No bony tenderness on palpation of the foot. Neurovascular intact. Capillary refill is less than 3 seconds with a strong dorsalis pedis pulse. Sensation is intact to light touch.\n\nRESULTS\n\n3 views of the right ankle were taken today. These reveal no evidence of fracture.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nRight ankle sprain.\n\nPLAN\n\nAfter reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. We discussed that his x-rays did not reveal any signs of a fracture and that he sustained a right ankle sprain. Treatment options were discussed. He was advised to keep his right lower extremity elevated, especially when seated. He will also continue to ice his right ankle. An Aircast was provided today to help stabilize his ankle. He is to also utilize crutches for the next 1 to 2 days followed by weight-bearing as tolerated. For pain control he can continue to take NSAIDs as needed. We discussed that he should see significant improvement in his symptoms over the next 2 weeks.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nThe patient will follow up with me in 2 weeks to assess his progress and to determine his return to play date. He is advised to call the office should his symptoms change or worsen prior to his next appointment.\n\n</gold_response>\nCarefully review the <response> based on the <conversation> and compare it to the <gold_response> when needed.\n\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Does the note provide correct clinical information based on the conversation?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the note include all important medical details from the conversation?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the note written clearly and organized in a standard clinical format for clinicians\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

    "predicted_text": "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:\nElizabeth is a 53-year-old female presenting with a three-month history of exertional chest pressure and dull pain, primarily triggered by walking. She reports that the pain is pressure-like, localized, and does not radiate. Currently, she denies chest pain, shortness of breath, diaphoresis, or clamminess. She has a past medical history of diabetes and high blood pressure, with recent concerns about elevated blood pressure readings. She notes increased blood sugars due to decreased activity and dietary challenges, including a preference for sodas. She has an upcoming ophthalmology appointment for diabetic retinopathy screening.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM:\nVital signs and exam findings include no jugular venous distension, no neck swelling, and no carotid bruits. Lung auscultation is clear without crackles or rhonchi. Cardiac exam reveals a regular rhythm with a grade II/VI systolic ejection murmur; no other abnormal heart sounds. Pulses are equal bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, without masses or guarding. Back exam is unremarkable. Extremity exam shows mild, one-plus nonpitting edema in the lower legs; no calf tenderness. No signs of acute heart failure or other acute abnormalities.\n\nRESULTS:\nAn in-office EKG was performed, showing no signs of acute ischemia or infarction. Blood pressure readings have been elevated over time, though not yet diagnosed as hypertension. Hemoglobin A1c was previously 7%, indicating fair glycemic control. No recent side effects from metformin reported. The physical exam indicates mild lower extremity edema but otherwise normal findings.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\n1. Chest pain (suspected unstable angina): Given the exertional nature and risk factors (diabetes, possible hypertension, family history), initiate cardiology referral, start aspirin 81 mg daily, and prescribe nitroglycerin for symptomatic relief. Educate patient on use and urgency of seeking emergency care if pain persists after three doses or does not resolve. Plan for stress testing once cardiology evaluates her.\n2. Diabetes mellitus: Continue metformin 500 mg twice daily. Order repeat hemoglobin A1c in two weeks to assess control. Reinforce dietary modifications and adherence to exercise. Continue ophthalmology follow-up for diabetic retinopathy.\n3. Hypertension: Suspected based on trend in blood pressure readings; not yet diagnosed. Initiate hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg daily, with instructions for home BP monitoring and logging results. Follow-up in two weeks to assess response and adjust therapy as needed. Educate on potential side effects.\n4. Lower extremity edema: Mild, likely related to early hypertension or other factors; monitor and reassess at follow-up.\n\nFollow-up scheduled in two weeks for reassessment of blood pressure, diabetes control, and cardiology evaluation.",

these tags:\n<conversation>\nDoctor-patient dialogue:\n\n[doctor] so elizabeth is a 53 -year-old female today complaining of chest pain and she has a past medical history of diabetes and high blood pressure so elizabeth tell me what's going on with your with your chest pain\n[patient] i do n't know every time i start walking i'm just having this kind of pressure and chest pain in my chest\n[doctor] okay are you having it now or is it gone right now\n[patient] right now it's not there\n[doctor] okay and how long have you been having this\n[patient] probably maybe three months\n[doctor] okay and what seemed to bring it on anything exacerbated or relieve it\n[patient] it mainly happens when i'm walking i like to try and walk but lately i just have n't been able to keep up with it because i'm having this pain\n[doctor] alright and well how would you describe this pain it's like a dull pain sharp pain stabbing pain how would you describe it\n[patient] i would say it's dull it's kinda like a pressure\n[doctor] okay and does it go anywhere or radiate any place\n[patient] no\n[doctor] okay alright but no chest pain right now no shortness of breath no sweats or clamminess or anything like that right now\n[patient] nothing right now\n[doctor] okay alright well certainly you know i looked at your ekg that did we did in the office when you came in the ekg i do n't see any signs of a heart attack or anything like that so i'm you know we should definitely talk about the plan for this chest pain in a few minutes but right now the good news is i do n't see any signs of a heart attack or anything like that so let's talk a little bit about your other conditions since you are here today how are you doing with your diabetes i know we have you on metformin and we talked about last time about you know improving your diet and exercise i'm glad you're exercising but i'm so sorry to hear about the chest pain so tell me about how is that going\n[patient] yeah i mean i think my blood sugars have been a little higher because i have n't been able to be active and i'm trying with the diet you know i do love sodas so i'm really trying strength dose\n[doctor] yeah i i am addicted to diet coke myself so i i hear you on that one and we had checked your hemoglobin a1c last time it was you know seven . which is pretty good it's not you know it could be better but it's not it's not bad and we talked about sending you to ophthalmology also for an eye exam have you seen ophthalmology in the last few months or last before i saw you\n[patient] i have an appointment in two weeks it was a long waiting\n[doctor] okay got it and any nausea vomiting or diarrhea or anything like that with your diabetes or any side effects from your medications the metformin\n[patient] no\n[doctor] okay alright good and i saw also there was a record in your i was looking at your record before previously before i walked in you also had we've been checking your blood pressure but but i think you've been into several other clinicians and they had documented high blood pressure have you noticed any findings with that or have you know have anybody talked about high blood pressure with you or mentioned that because we do n't have it in our system here yet but i did add it in today but we do n't have you on any medications yet for that\n[patient] no i mean i do n't know doc no one told me about high blood pressure do i have high blood pressure\n[doctor] well i think the last time you were in the clinic and one of the clinics said the referrals the your blood pressure was elevated so they had mentioned that i noticed a trend in your blood pressure it's been running on a little bit on the high side we have n't really diagnosed you with that yet but i think we are something that we should definitely consider looking at your trend of your blood pressure readings over the last you know a few years\n[patient] okay do you think that could be causing me my my chest pain\n[doctor] it certainly could be contributing to that it certainly could be a factor that we need to look at so\n[patient] someone had told me before\n[doctor] yeah me too but we we can we can definitely you know get you started on some monitoring devices for that and also maybe start you on some some diet control things that we can do to help with the blood pressure and maybe start you on some blood pressure medications if we need to okay\n[patient] okay sounds good\n[doctor] so let me examine you elizabeth for a second for the because we're running out of time here for a second so i'm gon na go ahead and do my exam we got ta just did my magical exam and i'm gon na go ahead and verbalize some of my findings just so i can get it documented in my note okay and i'll explain things as we go along so there is no jvd there is no swelling in your neck there's no carotid bruits your lung exam is clear i do n't hear any crackles or rhonchi your heart exam you do have a two over six systolic ejection murmur you had that in the past otherwise it's regular rate and rhythm your pulses are equal your belly exam is nice and soft your no tenderness no guarding no masses that i can feel on your belly and your back exam is fine your extremity exam you have a little bit of swelling in your lower legs one plus nonpitting edema or swelling in the in your in your ankle area here no calf tenderness so what does all this mean i'll explain that in a second so basically your exam is pretty normal except for you have a little bit of swelling in your legs so you know with this chest pain i'm a little bit so the first diagnosis that we talk about is this chest pain i'm worried about my suspicion is you have something called unstable angina especially considering your history of diabetes and the suspected history of high blood pressure and your family history of of heart disease in the past as well i'm i'm gon na go ahead and refer you to cardiology i reviewed your ekg today so that looks normal so that's good no other signs of a heart attack but i am worried that you may have some sort of a blockage going on that's causing this chest pain i'm gon na go ahead and start you on some aspirin daily i'm also gon na give you a prescription just a baby aspirin you can take eighty one milligrams once a day and also i'm gon na give you a prescription for nitroglycerin it's a it's a little pill you split underneath your tongue if you have this chest pain if it does n't go away after one or two pills i want you to go to the hospital call nine one one and go to the hospital but we will try to get you into cardiology the next week and get you set up for some sort of a stress test to look at your heart okay any questions about that\n[patient] so anytime i have a chest pain even if i'm just like walking i have to take that pill\n[doctor] yeah if you if you stop walking the chest pain goes away you do n't have to take the pill but if you are walking or you stop and the chest pain does not go away i would take the pill and see if it goes away if it does not\n[patient] how long like how long do i wait to see if it goes away\n[doctor] about five minutes so you can take it up to three pills every five minutes and if it does n't go away then i would you know go to the hospital and get this checked out because i worry about with this chest pain that you're having making sure it does n't lead to a heart attack those chest pain could be a you know a a a sign that you may be having some less blood flow to your heart and we need to get that checked out pretty quickly\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] alright\n[patient] mm-hmm\n[doctor] and for the second problem the diabetes you know i think you're doing fairly well continue with your eye ophthalmology appointment you have for your eye exam for the diabetic retinopathy continue the metformin five hundred milligrams twice a day i'm gon na order another hemoglobin a1c today and i'm gon na have you come back in about two weeks and we can see if we need to make any adjustments continue to try to stay away from you know the the pop and the sweet things and once we have your heart taken care of or make sure your heart is okay you can and we can hopefully resolve this chest pain that you're having get back to your exercise regimen okay any questions about that\n[patient] no\n[doctor] okay and for the third diagnosis the high blood pressure you you do have a trend i've noticed in your chart that your blood pressure's been running a little bit high several other people have documented as well i'm gon na go ahead and start you on some hydrochlorothiazide it's a pretty low dose medication to help you with your blood pressure plus it'll also help with you some of the swelling you have in your in your feet i'm gon na have you use a blood pressure cuff at home and enter your findings at epic mychart and i'll get a reading of those as well and then what when you come back in two weeks we'll keep a log of your blood pressure daily in the morning when you wake up and see how things are going and then if we need to make any adjustments to the medications we can but especially considering your history and the chest pain and the diabetes and the swelling i think starting this hydrochlorothiazide is a probably a good idea\n[patient] okay are there any side effects with this medication\n[doctor] yeah it can cause sometimes it can cause a little bit of make you go to the bathroom a little bit more often in the evening but generally most people do n't have a whole lot of side effects i'll give you a handout of the side effects but sometimes you can have a cross reaction with some other medications like sulfa medications but generally most people tolerate this pretty well\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] alright any other questions we got\n[patient] that's it\n[doctor] alright well great seeing you thanks for coming in today\n[patient] thank you appreciate it\n</conversation>\nThe generated note will be provided in these tags:\n<response>\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:\nElizabeth is a 53-year-old female presenting with a three-month history of exertional chest pressure and dull pain, primarily triggered by walking. She reports that the pain is pressure-like, localized, and does not radiate. Currently, she denies chest pain, shortness of breath, diaphoresis, or clamminess. She has a past medical history of diabetes and high blood pressure, with recent concerns about elevated blood pressure readings. She notes increased blood sugars due to decreased activity and dietary challenges, including a preference for sodas.

She has not been formally diagnosed with hypertension, but her blood pressures have been trending high.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY\n\nPatient reports family history of heart disease.\n\nMEDICATIONS\n\nPatient reports taking metformin 500 mg twice daily.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nConstitutional: Denies diaphoresis or clamminess.\nCardiovascular: Reports chest pain.\nRespiratory: Denies dyspnea.\nGastrointestinal: Denies nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nNeck\n- General Examination: No JVD, swelling, or carotid bruits.\n\nRespiratory\n- Assessment of Respiratory Effort:\n- Auscultation of Lungs: Clear bilaterally.

No calf tenderness.\n\nRESULTS\n\nEKG was obtained and reviewed in office today and is unremarkable. Hemoglobin A1c: 7.0\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN\n\n1. Chest pain.\n- Medical Reasoning: Considering her history of diabetes, possible history of hypertension, and family history of heart disease, I suspect her chest pain is likely unstable angina. Her recent EKG was unremarkable and there are no other signs of heart attack, but I am worried she may have some sort of a blockage causing her pain.\n- Patient Education and Counseling: We discussed proper protocol for sublingual nitroglycerin for chest pain. I advised her to go to the emergency department if the medication is not effective after approximately 5 minutes.\n- Medical Treatment: We will have her start a regimen of baby aspirin at 81 mg daily, for which I have sent in a prescription today. I also sent a prescription for nitroglycerin up to 3 tablets every 5 minutes as needed. Finally, I am going to have her follow up with cardiology for further evaluation.\n\n2. Type 2 diabetes.\n- Medical Reasoning: She appears to be doing well on her current regimen.\n- Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged the patient to keep her appointment with ophthalmology for evaluation of diabetic retinopathy.\n- Medical Treatment: I'm going to put in an order for a repeat hemoglobin A1c to check for any needed medication adjustments and have her follow up in 2 weeks. In the meantime, I want her to continue with metformin 500 mg twice daily and dietary modifications.\n\n3. Hypertension.\n- Medical Reasoning: Several providers, including myself, have noted a trend of elevated blood pressures in the patient's chart.\n- Patient Education and Counseling: I advised the patient to monitor her blood pressures at home over the next 2 weeks and report her readings to me via MyChart. This should help us determine if any adjustments need to be made to her new medications. We discussed the possible side effects of hydrochlorothiazide how this will hopefully reduce some of her swelling seen on physical exam. All of her questions were answered.\n- Medical Treatment: I'm going to have her start hydrochlorothiazide at a low dose.\n\nPatient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nThe patient will follow up in 2 weeks.\n</gold_response>\nCarefully review the <response> based on the <conversation> and compare it to the <gold_response> when needed.\n\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Does the note provide correct clinical information based on the conversation?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the note include all important medical details from the conversation?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the note written clearly and organized in a standard clinical format for clinicians\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

    "predicted_text": "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:\nSophia presents with a six-month history of bilateral knee pain described as deep, achy, and located behind the kneecaps, with occasional creaking sounds. The pain worsens with activities such as transitioning from sitting to standing, rising from a seated position, walking upstairs, and after prolonged periods of activity like watching TV. Rest alleviates the discomfort. She reports no swelling, redness, or warmth, and has not experienced any recent injuries or trauma to the knees. She has a history of regular running, typically five to six miles daily outdoors, but has significantly decreased her activity due to pain.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM:\nVital signs are within normal limits. Musculoskeletal exam reveals normal gait and strength of 5/5 in lower extremities, except for 3/5 strength in bilateral leg abduction. Tenderness is noted on palpation of bilateral retinacula, and the positive patellar grind test indicates anterior knee pain. Squatting reproduces pain. No erythema, ecchymosis, warmth, or effusion is observed in the knees. Ligament stability tests (Lachman, anterior/posterior drawer, McMurray) are negative. Neuro exam shows symmetrical patellar and Achilles reflexes. X-ray of both knees shows no fractures or osteoarthritis.\n\nRESULTS:\nPhysical examination findings include tenderness over the retinacula and a positive patellar grind test. Imaging (X-ray) is unremarkable, showing no structural abnormalities such as fractures or osteoarthritis.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\nThe patient's symptoms are consistent with patellofemoral pain syndrome, a common cause of anterior knee pain in active young individuals. Management includes continuation of NSAIDs (ibuprofen) as needed for pain, and initiation of physical therapy focused on strengthening lower extremity muscles, improving mobility, and correcting running mechanics. The goal is to reduce pain and restore running activity, with a gradual return to activity monitored over subsequent visits. The patient is advised to avoid running for now and to take it easy, with follow-up to assess progress.",

that i've been having for about six months now\n[doctor] okay do you remember what caused the pain initially\n[patient] you know i really ca n't recall any specific event that caused the pain\n[doctor] alright well can can you describe the pain for me\n[patient] yeah so it's it's like a deep achy pain that it i feel like it's behind my kneecaps and sometimes i can even hear like what seems like like some creaking in my knees\n[doctor] hmmm alright now tell me what what type of activities makes that pain worse\n[patient] so i feel like the pain gets worse anytime i'm like getting from like a seated position to standing so i i work from home so i'm at my desk a lot so anytime i get up i have some pain or after watching tv or even like going up and down stairs it's really painful\n[doctor] hmmm okay and does anything make the pain feel better\n[patient] usually after i rest it for some time it does help with the pain\n[doctor] okay now you did mention earlier that you have tried some things in the past can you tell me what they were\n[patient] yeah so when it first started hurting i was putting ice on it and i even got like some ace bandage like wrapping from the pharmacy i do take ibuprofen or aleve sometimes but i try to avoid really taking any medications\n[doctor] okay and and tell me what is your day like\n[patient] well i try to be as active as i can i actually love to run and i would run like five to six miles a day but now i i mean honestly i ca n't even get to half a mile and my leg will start hurting my knee will start hurting\n[doctor] okay that's definitely a decrease in your mileage there where have you been running lately like do you run outside or on a treadmill or\n[patient] yeah i i you know i will do the treadmill during the winter but i just love being outdoors and running\n[doctor] yeah yeah there are some really nice senior routes here in boston is n't there like\n[patient] there are\n[doctor] so many knee places there's some right by the harbor that i've i've done some runs there before too it's pretty nice well i mean the boston marathon what can you say right\n[patient] right exactly exactly no it's very nice\n[doctor] well okay well hopefully that we get you feeling better so you can start running again more than . five miles but tell me though have you noticed any swelling or redness in your knees\n[patient] no not really\n[doctor] okay and have you ever injured your knees before\n[patient] no i've been pretty good i actually have never broken a bone actually no i'm gon na change that actually i did break my arm when i was in sixth grade but nothing since then\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] i\n[doctor] okay and it's just your arm right not not your knee\n[patient] right\n[doctor] okay well alright well let's go ahead and do a quick physical exam on you here let me look at your vital signs okay i reviewed your vitals they they overall they look good take a listen to your heart real quick alright and your heart exam i hear regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs and on your musculoskeletal exam i have seen you and walk around here and you do have normal gait alright now i'm gon na have you do some movements on your legs here okay\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] alright good your strength is three out of five for abduction of legs bilaterally and the remainder of muscle strength for your lower extremities are five out of five so that's good let me take a look at your knee now on your knee exam there is no overlying erythema that's redness or ecchymosis and that's bruising or any warmth of the skin appreciated there is no effusion let me go ahead and feel around here does that hurt right here how does that feel\n[patient] it does\n[doctor] sorry so there is tenderness to palpation of the bilateral retinacular retinaculum and there is positive patellar grind test alright and can you are you able to squat for me\n[patient] i can but that hurts\n[doctor] okay alright so you're definitely having some knee pain with squatting and i'm just gon na maneuver your leg just a little bit here real quick okay so lachman anterior and posterior drawer and mcmurray tests are all negative bilaterally so that's good there okay now your neuro exam patella and achilles reflexes are symmetrical alright so now i did review the results of your x-ray and both of your knees which shows no fractures or osteoarthritis so let me go ahead and tell you about my assessment and plan so for your problem of bilateral knee pain based on what you told me your exam and reviewing your mri your symptoms are consistent with patellofemoral pain syndrome and this is a very common condition that we see that causes knee pain especially in active young people so this condition has to do with the way your kneecap which is your patella how that moves along the groove of your thigh your thigh bone which is the femur now for the pain you may continue taking ibuprofen or anti-inflammatory as needed to help with the pain but i'm also going to recommend physical therapy where where they will show you a number of lower extremity exercises and this will help increase your lower extremity strength your mobility and correct any incorrect running mechanics that you may have so do you have any questions for me about that\n[patient] will i be able to run anytime soon\n[doctor] well that is a goal of treatment and to get you back in running again now you will have to take an take it easy from running for now but we will continue to assess your progress with each visit okay\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] alright anything else\n[patient] no i think that's it\n[doctor] okay well very good well i will be following up with you soon and again just take it easy for now from the running okay\n[patient] okay thank you\n[doctor] bye\n[patient] bye\n</conversation>\nThe generated note will be provided in these tags:\n<response>\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:\nSophia presents with a six-month history of bilateral knee pain described as deep, achy, and located behind the kneecaps, with occasional creaking sounds. The pain worsens with activities such as transitioning from sitting to standing, rising from a seated position, walking upstairs, and after prolonged periods of activity like watching TV. Rest alleviates the discomfort. She reports no swelling, redness, or warmth, and has not experienced any recent injuries or trauma to the knees. She has a history of regular running, typically five to six miles daily outdoors, but has significantly decreased her activity due to pain.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM:\nVital signs are within normal limits. Musculoskeletal exam reveals normal gait and strength of 5/5 in lower extremities, except for 3/5 strength in bilateral leg abduction. Tenderness is noted on palpation of bilateral retinacula, and the positive patellar grind test indicates anterior knee pain. Squatting reproduces pain. No erythema, ecchymosis, warmth, or effusion is observed in the knees. Ligament stability tests (Lachman, anterior/posterior drawer, McMurray) are negative. Neuro exam shows symmetrical patellar and Achilles reflexes. X-ray of both knees shows no fractures or osteoarthritis.\n\nRESULTS:\nPhysical examination findings include tenderness over the retinacula and a positive patellar grind test. Imaging (X-ray) is unremarkable, showing no structural abnormalities such as fractures or osteoarthritis.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\nThe patient's symptoms are consistent with patellofemoral pain syndrome, a common cause of anterior knee pain in active young individuals. Management includes continuation of NSAIDs (ibuprofen) as needed for pain, and initiation of physical therapy focused on strengthening lower extremity muscles, improving mobility, and correcting running mechanics. The goal is to reduce pain and restore running activity, with a gradual return to activity monitored over subsequent visits. The patient is advised to avoid running for now and to take it easy, with follow-up to assess progress.\n</response>\nThe reference note will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nCHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nBilateral knee pain.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nSophia Jackson is a pleasant 30-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of bilateral knee pain. She was referred by her primary care provider. The onset of her pain began 6 months ago. She denies any specific injury. The patient describes her pain as a deep, achy pain. She locates her pain to the posterior aspect of her patellae. The patient also reports \u201ccreaking\u201d in her knees. She denies any swelling or redness in her knees. Her pain is aggravated by transitioning from a seated position to standing as well as ascending and descending stairs. Her pain is alleviated by rest. The patient has been icing her knees and wrapping her knees with an ACE bandage. She also takes ibuprofen or Aleve occasionally for pain. She states she tries to be as active as she can. She enjoys running outdoors. The patient adds that she would run 5 to 6 miles per day; however, she is unable to go 0.5 miles secondary to the pain. She denies any previous injuries to her knees.\n\nShe works from home.\n\nMEDICAL HISTORY\n\nPatient reports history of an upper extremity fracture when she was in 6th grade.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nMusculoskeletal: Reports bilateral knee pain and crepitus. Denies swelling or redness in the bilateral knees.\n\nVITALS\n\nAll vital signs are within the normal limits.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nGAIT: Normal, no deformity present.\nCV: Auscultation of Heart: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs.\nNo edema\nNEURO: Patella and Achilles reflexes are symmetrical.\nMSK: Examination of the bilateral lower extremities: Abduction strength is 3/5. Remainder of muscle strength is 5/5. Examination of the bilateral knees: No overlying erythema, ecchymosis, or warmth of the skin appreciated. No effusion. Tenderness to palpation of the bilateral retinaculum. Positive patellar grind test. Knee pain with squatting. Negative Lachman test bilaterally. Negative anterior and posterior drawer tests bilaterally. Negative McMurray test bilaterally.\n\nRESULTS\n\nX-rays of the bilateral knees were reviewed today. These demonstrate no evidence of any fractures or osteoarthritis.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nBilateral knee patellofemoral pain syndrome.\n\nPLAN\n\nAfter reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient regarding her current symptoms. I have explained to her that her symptoms are consistent with patellofemoral pain syndrome. We discussed treatment options and I have recommended that we begin with conservative treatment in the form of formal physical therapy to increase her lower extremity strength, mobility, and correct any incorrect running mechanics. I encouraged her to take running easy for now. She can continue taking ibuprofen or anti-inflammatories as needed for pain. All questions were answered.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nThe patient will follow up with me soon.\n</gold_response>\nCarefully review the <response> based on the <conversation> and compare it to the <gold_response> when needed.\n\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Does the note provide correct clinical information based on the conversation?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the note include all important medical details from the conversation?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the note written clearly and organized in a standard clinical format for clinicians\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

alright this this is a no judgment zone i there i'm working through some things in my head to make sure that i give you the best care that we need right i'm making a plan as we move along you mentioned that the pain has been getting worse have you done anything or tried anything that's worked in the past\n[patient] i tried to take some ibuprofen and tylenol\n[doctor] mm-hmm\n[patient] that that sometimes helps\n[doctor] okay alright and has anyone discussed the option of like just no has anyone discussed surgery with you\n[patient] no this is the first time i'm talking about it\n[doctor] okay alright that's good so what is your like how what is your activity level right now that i know that you're you know an olympic weightlifter with books what else do you do to like

conditions\n[patient] yeah my dad has back pain\n[doctor] okay alright and then do you smoke\n[patient] i do n't smoke\n[doctor] okay awesome alright so sorry one question did you do you have a history of playing sports\n[patient] yes\n[doctor] okay what did you play\n[patient] soccer\n[doctor] okay what position\n[patient] i played midfield\n[doctor] okay the people who hide in the back that's fine i was centered forward fine no baby do you have a team that you wrote for\n[patient] you know i am a tatnham hotsper fan\n[doctor] they have the best colors not going to lie but i i grew up manu so sorry\n[patient] well i wo n't fault you for that\n[doctor] thanks okay so if you do n't mind i'm gon na go ahead and do my physical exam i'm gon na call out my findings just to have them recorded and if you have any questions please feel free to stop me and let me know okay\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] alright so looking at your vitals your blood pressure seems alright we are in like the one thirty over seventy range that's perfectly fine your respiratory rate i have you at an eighteen again pretty normal when i listen here to your heart you have a regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmurs rubs or gallops that means your heart sounds great on your respiratory exam your lungs sound clear to auscultation bilaterally on your musculoskeletal back exam as i'm looking here i do n't notice any overlying redness or bruising on the skin when i push here on the midline of your back does it hurt\n[patient] yes\n[doctor] okay so there is midline tenderness at the l4 l5 disk space with right sided lumbar paravertebral tenderness alright so are you able to bend forward\n[patient] yes\n[doctor] alright and are you able to bend backward\n[patient] yes\n[doctor] alright do either of those actions cause you pain\n[patient] bending forward\n[doctor] okay so pain with lumbar flexion and so i'm gon na have you lie down and we're gon na do i'm sorry okay and then i see that a supine straight leg test is positive alright so for your neurological exam you said that you are experiencing pain radiating down radiating down your left leg correct\n[patient] yes\n[doctor] alright when i touch are there any like decreased sensation\n[patient] no\n[doctor] okay alright so patella and achilles reflexes are symmetrical alright so i received before you came in here we got an mri and so in reviewing your results it does show a disk desiccation a disk bulge with paracentral disk herniation resulting in moderate right neuroforaminal i do n't like this word neural foraminal stenosis what those complicated words is that i just said is that it seems that you have a a a herniated disk with nerve impingement so let's talk about my assessment and plan alright your symptoms are in line with a i'm sorry you have lumbar back pain at the l4 l5 disk space due to a herniated disk with radiculopathy this means that one of your disks that sits between your vertebrae like the bones in your spine is bulging out and the bulge is pinching on some nerves so that's why you are feeling that pain like radiating down your leg i'm gon na recommend something a spinal injection with a strong nsaid and called the i'm sorry and a corticosteroid i'm just gon na inject it into the lumbar spine under fluoroscopy which you can think of like an x-ray to localize the exact area of your pain this should help with the inflammation that's causing your pain i know that sounds a bit scary it this is a typical procedure that i do all the time it's in office and we can get you scheduled today if you would like so what questions do you have right now\n[patient] is that something that we can do today\n[doctor] yeah i think i have time in my schedule to get it done today just you know i'm here for you right now\n[patient] alright\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] are there are there any complications with this\n[doctor] there are sorry yeah you're right there are risks associated with this kind of injection just like any procedure but we aim to minimize them and my ma when she comes in we will give you some paperwork with explanations and any and hopefully answer most of the questions that you have if after reading that you have any more questions please feel free to stop us we want to make sure that you feel as comfortable as possible during this time\n[patient]

    "predicted_text": "**HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:**  \nAngela presents with left knee pain following a fall while running with her 5-year-old niece, during which she reports twisting her knee and hearing a pop. The pain has persisted for about a week, with increasing severity, now described as throbbing and rated as a 4/10 initially, worsening over time. She reports limping and difficulty bearing weight on the affected leg. The pain is localized more medially than laterally, with tenderness on the inside of the knee. She has been using Tylenol for pain relief but notes limited effectiveness and cannot take NSAIDs due to a recent ulcer.\n\n**PHYSICAL EXAM:**  \nOn examination, there is tenderness on the medial side of the left knee, with some edema and effusion. Range of motion is moderate, with pain on both flexion and extension. Ligament stability tests, including Lachman, valgus, and varus, are negative, indicating no gross ligament tears. No fractures or bony abnormalities are seen on the recent knee X-ray.\n\n**RESULTS:**  \nKnee X-ray was normal, showing no fractures or bony abnormalities. Physical exam suggests a soft tissue injury, likely a medial collateral ligament (MCL) strain, without evidence of ligament rupture or other structural damage.\n\n**ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:**  \nThe patient likely has an MCL strain resulting from twisting injury.

that you're trying to help her with the learning how to ride a bike\n[patient] yeah\n[doctor] that sounds fun but i'm i'm sad as you hurt your knee doing it so for your knee pain are you are you able to bear weight on that leg the left leg\n[patient] well i've been limping ever since and it really has n't gotten better so i thought it was maybe time to come see you because it happened about a week ago\n[doctor] yeah yeah it's a definitely a good time to come see me so what part of your knee would you say it hurts\n[patient] honestly it's been hurting on both sides more so on the inside than the the outside\n[doctor] so okay so more in the medial aspect less on the lateral okay that makes sense and you said did you hear a pop when you when you twisted it\n[patient] yeah i did\n[doctor] okay alright so how would you rate your pain with your knee out of out of one to ten\n[patient] it started off as like a four but i think it's getting worse and it's starting like it's it's like a like a throbbing kind of pain yeah\n[doctor] alright and have you taken anything for the pain\n[patient] yeah so i i had like a ulcer not too long ago so my doctor told me that i could n't take any like kind of advil or ibuprofen\n[doctor] mm-hmm\n[patient] so i've been taking some tylenol and i wrapped it with kinesiology tape are you familiar with that\n[doctor] yep yeah i'm i'm familiar\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] alright and has the has the ibuprofen been helping you at all\n[patient] i ca n't take ibuprofen\n[doctor] i mean i'm sorry the tylenol\n[patient] no it's okay but the tylenol it helps like a little bit but you know like it's it's got like a time limit right so by the time and i'm not supposed to take it like more than like every like four hours or something like that but by hour or two like it it hurts again\n[doctor] okay yeah that yeah you ca n't take too much of that tylenol because it'll it'll mess up your liver definitely\n[patient] right\n[doctor] alright so go ahead and do a quick exam on your knee here so when i press here does that hurt\n[patient] yeah like when you press on the inside that hurts a lot\n[doctor] okay alright i'm gon na do a couple of other other maneuvers here for your knee so on your left knee exam i do appreciate some edema you also have some effusion some fluid in the knee you have moderate range of motion so you're able to move it a little bit but not all the way i also see you have some pain on flexion and extension of the knee even negative lachman's test and a negative valgus and varus test as well so all that to say is i do n't think anything is is torn in your knee based on the your physical exam so we did do a x-ray of your left knee and luckily it was normal so there is no fractures no bony abnormalities so everything is good there so let me talk to you little bit about my assessment and plan for your knee okay\n[patient] yeah\n[doctor] alright so for your your left knee pain i believe you you have a mcl strain or a medial collateral ligament that's the inside of your knee i think when you were running with your knee she had somehow twisted it and so you strained that ligament there so for that what i want to do i'm going to give you some pain medication that's not an nsaid so i will put you on some tramadol you can take fifty milligrams you can do that twice a day and then you can take that tylenol as needed for breakthrough pain alright i'm gon na put you in a knee immobilizer leg knee immobilizer and you can wear that for the next week i just wan na keep the knee from moving so it can heal a little bit and reduce some of the inflammation that you're seeing here and i also want you to ice it and you can do that three or four times a day for twenty thirty minutes at a time and that should help some of that swelling as well and i i you know i know your niece is gon na be upset but i just do n't want you to be running probably for the next three weeks with her just to help us get time to let allow the knee to heal so how does that sound\n[patient] that's alright how long do you think it'll be before i can like run or something like that\n[doctor] hmmm i think you'll be back to normal in about a month the strain does n't seem too bad but we just need to get you off of the knee so we can allow it to heal i mean once we do that you know along with you know the icing the mobilization and you taking the medication i think you'll be good to go in a month if you do feel like you're getting a little bit worse please feel free to call the office and we can get you in and possibly do more imaging such as an mri to you know to see if it's anything worse but i do n't think it is but just let us know how you feel in a couple of days\n[patient] okay alright thanks\n[doctor] alright any other questions\n[patient] no that's it\n[doctor] alright great thanks\n</conversation>\nThe generated note will be provided in these tags:\n<response>\n**HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:**  \nAngela presents with left knee pain following a fall while running with her 5-year-old niece, during which she reports twisting her knee and hearing a pop. The pain has persisted for about a week, with increasing severity, now described as throbbing and rated as a 4/10 initially, worsening over time. She reports limping and difficulty bearing weight on the affected leg. The pain is localized more medially than laterally, with tenderness on the inside of the knee. She has been using Tylenol for pain relief but notes limited effectiveness and cannot take NSAIDs due to a recent ulcer.\n\n**PHYSICAL EXAM:**  \nOn examination, there is tenderness on the medial side of the left knee, with some edema and effusion. Range of motion is moderate, with pain on both flexion and extension. Ligament stability tests, including Lachman, valgus, and varus, are negative, indicating no gross ligament tears. No fractures or bony abnormalities are seen on the recent knee X-ray.\n\n**RESULTS:**  \nKnee X-ray was normal, showing no fractures or bony abnormalities. Physical exam suggests a soft tissue injury, likely a medial collateral ligament (MCL) strain, without evidence of ligament rupture or other structural damage.\n\n**ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:**  \nThe patient likely has an MCL strain resulting from twisting injury. Management includes prescribing tramadol 50 mg twice daily for pain, continued use of Tylenol as needed, and immobilization of the knee with a knee immobilizer for one week to limit movement and promote healing. Ice application three to four times daily for 20-30 minutes is recommended to reduce swelling. She is advised to avoid running or strenuous activity for approximately three weeks to allow healing, with an expected return to normal activity in about one month. The patient is instructed to monitor symptoms and contact the office if pain worsens or persists beyond this period, at which point further imaging such as MRI may be considered.\n</response>\nThe reference note will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nAngela Powell is a pleasant 81-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of left knee pain. The onset of her pain began 1 week ago, when she was running around with her niece and fell. At the time of the injury, she heard a pop and believes that she twisted her knee. She reports that she has been limping since the injury. The patient locates her pain to the medial and lateral aspects of her knee. She rates her pain level as a 4 out of 10, however this is increasing. Her pain is described as a throbbing pain. The patient has been taking Tylenol, which has provided mild and temporary relief, as well as wrapping her knee with kinesiology tape. She states that she is unable to take ibuprofen secondary to an ulcer.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nMSK: Examination of the left knee: Edema and effusion noted. Moderate ROM. Pain with flexion and extension of the knee. Negative Lachman's. Negative valgus and varus stress test.\n\nRESULTS\n\n4 views of the left knee were taken. These reveal no evidence of any fractures or dislocations. No other abnormalities are noted.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nLeft knee pain, possible MCL strain.\n\nPLAN\n\nAfter reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have discussed with the patient that her x-rays did not reveal any signs of a tear. I have recommended that we treat the patient conservatively. The plan is to place the patient in a knee immobilizer to provide increased support for the next week. I have also prescribed the patient tramadol 50 mg to treat her pain. She can take Tylenol as needed for breakthrough pain. I have also advised her to ice her left knee 3 to 4 times a day for 20 to 30 minutes at a time. I have advised her to refrain from running for the next 3 weeks. If her pain does not improve with the immobilizer, I will recommend obtaining an MRI.\n\n</gold_response>\nCarefully review the <response> based on the <conversation> and compare it to the <gold_response> when needed.\n\nFor each of the following criteria, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent),\nand provide a short justification for your score.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Does the note provide correct clinical information based on the conversation?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the note include all important medical details from the conversation?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the note written clearly and organized in a standard clinical format for clinicians\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput the evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",
