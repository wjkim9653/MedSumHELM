The patient states that he was working in his garage over the past few days when he noticed some redness and edema in his right foot. He notes some itching as well as increasing pain and redness in the right foot and presented to ABCD General Hospital Emergency Room. He was evaluated by the Emergency Room staff as well as the medical team and the Department of Orthopedics. It was noted upon x-ray a foreign body in his foot and he had significant amount of cellulitis as well ________ right lower extremity. After a long discussion held with the patient, it was elected to proceed with irrigation debridement and removal of the foreign body.PROCEDURE:  After all potential complications, risks, as well as anticipated benefits of the above-named procedures were discussed at length with the patient, informed consent was obtained. The operative extremity was then confirmed with the patient, operative surgeon, the Department of Anesthesia and nursing staff. The patient was then transferred to preoperative area to Operative Suite #5 and placed on the operating table in supine position. All bony prominences were well padded at this time. The Department of Anesthesia was administered spinal anesthetic to the patient. Once this anesthesia was obtained, the patient's right lower extremity was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. Upon viewing of the plantar aspect of the foot, there was noted to be a swollen ecchymotic area with a small hole in it, which purulent fluid was coming from. At this time, after all bony and soft tissue landmarks were identified as well as the localization of the pus, a 2 cm longitudinal incision was made directly over this area, which was located between the second and third metatarsal heads. Upon incising this, there was a foul smelling purulent fluid, which flowed from this region. Aerobic and anaerobic cultures were taken as well as gram stain. The area was explored and it ________ to the dorsum of the foot. There was no obvious joint involvement. After all loculations were broken, 3 liters antibiotic-impregnated fluid were pulse-evac through the wound. The wound was again inspected with no more gross purulent or necrotic appearing tissue. The wound was then packed with an iodoform gauge and a sterile dressing was applied consisting of 4x4s, floss, and Kerlix covered by an Ace bandage. At this time, the Department of Anesthesia reversed the sedation. The patient was transferred back to the hospital gurney to Postanesthesia Care Unit. The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no complications.DISPOSITION: The patient will be followed on a daily basis for possible repeat irrigation debridement.\nKeywords:\u00a0orthopedic, removal of foreign body, purulent material, metatarsal, cellulitis, abscess, kerlix, foreign body, foot, irrigation, debridement, purulent,\n</patient_information>\n\nThe proposed treatment plan will be provided in these tags:\n<response>\nBased on the provided clinical information, a comprehensive treatment plan for this patient should include the following components:\n\n1. **Postoperative Wound Care:**\n   - Maintain sterile dressing changes daily or as advised.\n   - Monitor the wound for signs of ongoing infection, such as increased redness, swelling, warmth, foul odor, or purulent discharge.\n   - Keep the foot elevated to reduce edema.\n   - Ensure proper offloading of the affected foot to prevent pressure on the wound.\n\n2. **Antibiotic Therapy:**\n   - Continue empiric broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics targeting both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, tailored based on intraoperative culture results and sensitivities.\n   - Adjust antibiotics as per microbiology reports.\n   - Complete the full course of antibiotics to prevent recurrence.\n\n3. **Glycemic Control:**\n   - Optimize blood glucose levels to promote wound healing and reduce infection risk.\n   - Collaborate with endocrinology if necessary.\n\n4. **Monitoring and Follow-up:**\n   - Schedule daily wound assessments, including inspection and possibly wound cultures if signs of infection persist.\n   - Repeat irrigation and debridement if there is evidence of persistent or recurrent infection.\n   - Consider imaging (e.g., X-ray or MRI) if osteomyelitis is suspected.\n\n5. **Management of Foreign Body:**\n   - Confirm complete removal of the foreign body; if any residual foreign material is suspected, further imaging or intervention may be necessary.\n   - Educate the patient on avoiding similar injuries.\n\n6. **Address Underlying Conditions:**\n   - Manage diabetes effectively to improve immune response and healing.\n   - Address any other comorbidities that may impair recovery.\n\n7. **Patient Education:**\n   - Instruct the patient on foot hygiene, signs of infection, and when to seek medical attention.\n   - Advise on proper footwear and protective measures to prevent future injuries.\n\n8. **Long-term Considerations:**\n   - Evaluate for potential need for reconstructive procedures if there is significant tissue loss.\n   - Consider referral to a wound care specialist or infectious disease specialist if healing is delayed.\n\n**Summary:**\nThis patient requires diligent postoperative wound management with appropriate antibiotics, strict glycemic control, regular follow-up, and patient education to promote healing and prevent recurrence.

There were two 20 mm 4.0 cancellous screws and one 18 mm 4.0 cancellous screw placed. There were two 4.0 cancellous partially-threaded screws placed.\nGROSS FINDINGS: Include a comminuted fracture involving the lateral malleolus as well as a medial and posterior malleolus fracture as well.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 87-year-old Caucasian female who presented to ABCD General Hospital Emergency Room complaining of right ankle pain status post a trip and fall. The patient noted while walking with a walker, apparently tripped and fell. The patient had significant comorbidities, seen and evaluated by the Emergency Room Department as well as Department of Orthopedics while in the Emergency Room. At that time, a closed reduction was performed and she was placed in a Robert-Jones splint. After complete medical workup and clearance, we elected to take her to the operating room for definitive care.PROCEDURE: After all potential complications and risks as well as risks and benefits of the above-mentioned procedure was discussed at length with the patient and family, informed consent was obtained. The upper extremity was then confirmed with the operating surgeon, the patient, the nursing staff and Department of Anesthesia. The patient was then transferred to preoperative area in the Operative Suite #3 and placed on the operating room table in supine position. At this time, the Department of Anesthesia administered spinal anesthetic to the patient as well as sedation. All bony prominences were well padded at this time. A nonsterile tourniquet was placed on the right upper thigh of the patient. This was then removed and the right lower extremity was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. The right lower extremity was then elevated and exsanguinated using Esmarch and tourniquet was then placed to 325 mmHg and kept up to a total of 75 minutes. Next, after all bony and soft tissue landmarks were identified, a 6 cm longitudinal incision was made directly over this vestibule on the right ankle. A sharp dissection was carefully taken down to the level of bone taking care to protect the neurovascular structures. Once the bone was reached, the fractured site was identified. The bony ends were then opened and divided of all hematoma as well as excess periosteum within the fracture site. The wound was copiously irrigated and dried. Next, the fracture was then reduced in anatomic position. There was noted to be quite a bit of comminution as well as soft overall status of the bone. It was held in place with reduction forceps. A six hole one-third tubular Synthes plate was then selected for instrumentation. It was contoured using ________ and placed on the lateral aspect of the distal fibula. Next, the three most proximal holes were sequentially drilled using a 2.5 mm drill bed, depth gauged and then a 3.5 mm fully threaded cortical screw was placed in each. The most proximal was a 12 mm and the next two were 16 mm in length. Next, the three most distal holes were sequentially drilled using a 2.5 mm drill bed, depth gauged, and a 4.0 cancellous screw was placed in each hole. The most distal with a 20 mm and two most proximal were 18 mm in length. Next the Xi-scan was used to visualize the hardware placement as well as the fracture reduction appeared to be in good anatomic position, all hardware was in good position. There was no lateralization of the joints. Attention was then directed towards the medial aspect of the ankle. Again, after all bony and soft tissue landmarks were identified, a 4 cm longitudinal incision was made directly over the medial malleolus. Again, the dissection was carefully taken down the level of the fracture site. The retractors were then placed to protect all neurovascular structures. Once the fracture site was identified, it was dried of all hematoma as well as excess periosteum. The fracture site was then displaced and the ankle joint was visualized including the dome of the talus. There appeared to be some minor degenerative changes of the talus, but no loose bodies. Next, the wound was copiously irrigated and suctioned dry. The medial malleolus was placed in reduced position and held in place with a 1.25 mm K-wire. Next, the 2.5 mm drill bed was then used to sequentially drill holes to full depth and 4.0 cancellous screws were placed in each, each with a 45 mm in length. These appeared to hold the fracture site securely in an anatomic position. Again, Xi-scan was brought in to confirm placement of the screws. They were in good overall position and there was no lateralization of the joint. At this time, each wound was copiously irrigated and suctioned dry. The wounds were then closed using #2-0 Vicryl suture in subcutaneous fashion followed by staples on the skin. A sterile dressing was applied consistent with Adaptic, 4x4s, Kerlix, and Webril. A Robert-Jones style splint was then placed on the right lower extremity. This was covered by a 4-inch Depuy dressing. At this time, the Department of Anesthesia reversed the sedation. The patient was transferred back to the hospital gurney and to the Postanesthetic Care Unit. The patient tolerated the procedure well.

He has a past history of known hyperthyroidism since 1992 and a more recent history of atrial fibrillation and congestive cardiac failure with an ejection fraction of 20%-25%. The main cause for his shortness of breath was believed to be due to atrial fibrillation secondary to hyperthyroidism in a setting with congestive cardiac failure. During his hospital stay, he was commenced on metoprolol for rate control, and given that he had atrial fibrillation, he was also started on warfarin, which his INR has been followed up by the Homeless Clinic. For his congestive cardiac failure, he was restarted on Digoxin and lisinopril. For his hyperthyroidism, we restarted him on PTU and the endocrinologists were happy to review him when he was euthymic to discuss further radioiodine or radiotherapy. He was restarted on PTU and discharged from the hospital on this medication. While in the hospital, it was also noted that he abused cigarettes and cocaine, and we advised strongly against this given the condition of his heart. It was also noted that he had elevated liver function tests, which an ultrasound was normal, but his hepatitis panel was pending. Since his discharge, his hepatitis panel has come back normal for hepatitis A, B, and C. Since discharge, the patient has complained of shortness of breath, mainly at night when lying flat, but otherwise he states he has been well and compliant with his medication.MEDICATIONS: Digoxin 250 mcg daily, lisinopril 5 mg daily, metoprolol 50 mg twice daily, PTU (propylthiouracil) 300 mg orally four times a day, warfarin variable dose based on INR.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:VITAL SIGNS: He was afebrile today.

Respiratory rate 25.HEENT: Obvious exophthalmus, but no obvious lid lag today.NECK: There was no thyroid mass palpable.CHEST: Clear except for occasional bibasilar crackles.CARDIOVASCULAR: Heart sounds were dual, but irregular, with no additional sounds.\nABDOMEN: Soft, nontender, nondistended.EXTREMITIES: Mild +1 peripheral edema in both legs.\n</patient_information>\n\nThe proposed treatment plan will be provided in these tags:\n<response>\nBased on the patient's history, current clinical findings, and ongoing management, a comprehensive treatment plan should include the following components:\n\n1. **Management of Heart Failure and Atrial Fibrillation:**\n   - Continue current medications:\n     - Digoxin 250 mcg daily for rate control.\n     - Lisinopril 5 mg daily for afterload reduction and heart failure management.\n     - Metoprolol 50 mg twice daily for rate control.\n     - Warfarin with INR monitoring to maintain therapeutic anticoagulation.\n   - Monitor for signs of worsening heart failure, such as increasing edema, dyspnea, or fatigue.\n   - Consider optimizing diuretic therapy if peripheral edema or pulmonary congestion worsens.\n   - Regular echocardiography to monitor ejection fraction and cardiac function.\n\n2. **Management of Hyperthyroidism:**\n   - Continue PTU (propylthiouracil) 300 mg four times daily.\n   - Monitor thyroid function tests (TSH, free T4, free T3) regularly to assess euthyroidism.\n   - Once euthyroid is achieved, consider endocrinology consultation to evaluate for definitive therapy:\n     - Radioiodine ablation or surgical thyroidectomy, depending on patient preference and clinical suitability.\n   - Watch for signs of hypothyroidism after therapy initiation.\n\n3. **Addressing Respiratory Symptoms and Edema:**\n   - Given the nocturnal orthopnea and bibasilar crackles, consider:\n     - Up-titration of diuretics (e.g., furosemide) to manage volume overload.\n     - Chest X-ray to evaluate pulmonary congestion if not recently performed.\n   - Elevate the legs to reduce peripheral edema.\n   - Monitor weight daily to assess fluid status.\n\n4. **Liver Function and Hepatitis Monitoring:**\n   - Continue to monitor liver function tests periodically.\n   - Since hepatitis panel is normal, no specific antiviral treatment is indicated.\n   - Avoid hepatotoxic medications if possible.\n\n5. **Lifestyle Modifications and Risk Factor Reduction:**\n   - Strongly advise cessation of smoking and cocaine use to reduce cardiovascular risk.\n   - Provide counseling or referral to substance abuse programs.\n   - Encourage a low-sodium diet to help control edema and hypertension.\n   - Promote adherence to medications and follow-up appointments.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations:**\n   - Regular follow-up with cardiology, endocrinology, and primary care.\n   - Educate the patient about recognizing signs of worsening heart failure (e.g\n</response>\n\nThe gold standard treatment plan will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nThe patient has also been attending the Homeless Clinic since discharge from the hospital, where he has been receiving quality care and they have been looking after every aspect of his health, including his hyperthyroidism. It is our recommendation that a TSH and T4 be continually checked until the patient is euthymic, at which time he should attend endocrine review with Dr. Huffman for further treatment of his hyperthyroidism. Regarding his atrial fibrillation, he is moderately rate controlled with metoprolol 50 mg b.i.d. His rate in clinic today was 92. He could benefit from increasing his metoprolol dose, however, in the hospital it was noted that he was bradycardic in the morning with a pulse rate down to the 50s, and we were concerned with making this patient bradycardic in the setting of congestive cardiac failure. Regarding his congestive cardiac failure, he currently appears stable, with some variation in his weight. He states he has been taking his wife's Lasix tablets for diuretic benefit when he feels weight gain coming on and increased edema. We should consider adding him on a low-dose furosemide tablet to be taken either daily or when his weight is above his target range. A Digoxin level has not been repeated since discharge, and we feel that this should be followed up. We have also increased his lisinopril to 5 mg daily, but the patient did not receive his script upon departing our clinic. Regarding his elevated liver function tests, we feel that these are very likely secondary to hepatic congestion secondary to congestive cardiac failure with a normal ultrasound and normal hepatitis panel, but yet the liver function tests should be followed up.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully review the <response> based on the <patient_information> and compare it to the <gold_response> when needed.\n\nFor each category below, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent) and\nprovide a brief explanation for your score:\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Does the treatment plan provide correct medical advice based on clinical guidelines?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\nDoes the treatment plan include all important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the treatment plan written clearly so clinicians can easily understand it?\n\nOutput Format:\nGenerate a valid JSON object with the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

She states that they have been slowly progressive. She had a consultation with an outside neurologist and was told that she likely has Alzheimer disease and was prescribed Aricept and was told that she should not drive. Per the dictation that is available to us in clinic, it appears that she was before a DMV. It appears that the patient wanted a second opinion, so she now presents for consultation on possible Alzheimer disease.The patient states that she has been doing fairly well at home. She balances her own checkbook. She does not do her own taxes, but she has never done so in the past. She states that she has no problems with cooking meals, getting her own meals, and she is still currently driving. She denies burning any dishes because she forgot them on the stove or forgetting what she is doing in the middle of a task or getting lost while she is driving around or getting lost in her own home. She states that she is very good remembering the names of her family members and does not forget important birthdays such as the date of birth of her grandchildren. She is unfortunately living alone, and although she seems to miss her grandchildren and is estranged from her son, she denies any symptoms of frank depression. There is unfortunately no one available to us to corroborate how well she is doing at home. She lives alone and takes care of herself and does not communicate very much with her brother and sister. She also does not communicate very much with her son who lives in Santa Cruz or her grandchildren. She denied any sort of personality change, paranoid ideas or hallucinations. She does appear to have headaches that can be severe about four times a month and have primarily photophobia and some nausea and occasionally emesis associated with it. When these headaches are very severe, she goes to the emergency room to get a single shot. She is unclear if this is some sort of a migraine medication or just a primary pain medication. She takes Fiorinal for these headaches and she states that this helps greatly. She denies visual or migraine symptoms.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Negative for any sort of focal neurologic deficits such as weakness, numbness, visual changes, dysarthria, diplopia or dysphagia. She also denies any sort of movement disorders, tremors, rigidities or clonus. Her personal opinion is that some of her memory problems may be due to simply to her age and/or nervousness. She is unclear as if her memory is any worse than anyone else in her age group.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for mesothelioma, which was diagnosed seemingly more than 20 to 25 years ago. The patient was not sure of exactly when it was diagnosed. This has been treated surgically by debulking operations for which she states that she has undergone about 10 operations. The mesothelioma is in her abdomen. She does not know of any history of having lung mesothelioma. She states that she has never gotten chemotherapy or radiation for her mesothelioma. Furthermore, she states that her last surgical debulking was more than 10 years ago and her disease has been fairly stable. She does have a history of three car accidents that she says were all rear-enders where she was hit while essentially in a stopped position. These have all occurred over the past five years. She also has a diagnosis of dementing illness, possibly Alzheimer disease from her previous neurology consultation. This diagnosis was given in March 2006.MEDICATIONS: Fiorinal, p.r.n. aspirin, unclear if baby or full sized, Premarin unclear of the dose.\nALLERGIES: NONE.SOCIAL HISTORY: Significant for her being without a companion at this point. She was born in Munich, Germany. She immigrated to of America in 1957 after her family had to move to Eastern Germany, which was under Russian occupation at that time. She is divorced. She used to work as a secretary and later worked as a clerical worker at IBM. She stopped working more than 20 years ago due to complications from her mesothelioma. She denies any significant tobacco, alcohol or illicit drugs. She is bilingual speaking, German and English. She has known English from before her teens. She has the equivalent of a high school education in Germany. She has one brother and one sister, both of whom are healthy and she does not spend much time communicating with them. She has one son who lives in Santa Cruz. He has grandchildren. She is trying to contact with her grandchildren.FAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for lung, liver, and prostate cancer. Her mother died in her 80s of \"old age,\" but it appears that she may have had a mild dementing illness at that time. Whatever that dementing illness was, appears to have started mostly in her 80s per the patient. No one else appears to have Alzheimer disease including her brother and sister.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her blood pressure is 152/92, pulse 80, and weight 80.7 kg. She is alert and well nourished in no apparent distress. She occasionally fumbles with questions of orientation, missing the day and the date. She also did not know the name of the hospital, she thought it was O'Connor and she thought she was in Orange County and also did not know the floor of the hospital that we are in. She lost three points for recall. Even with prompting, she could not remember the objects that she was given to remember. Her Mini Mental Score was 22/30. There were no naming problems or problems with repetition. There were also no signs of dysarthria. Her pupils were bilaterally reactive to light and accommodation. Her extraocular movements were intact. Her visual fields were full to confrontation. Her sensations of her face, arm, and leg were normal. There were no signs of neglect with double simultaneous stimulation. Tongue was midline. Her palate was symmetric. Her face was symmetric as well. Strength was approximately 5/5. She did have some right knee pain and she had a mildly antalgic gait due to her right knee pain. Her reflexes were symmetric and +2 except for her toes, which were +1 to trace. Her plantar reflexes were mute. Her sensation was normal for pain, temperature, and vibration. There were no signs of ataxia on finger-to-nose and there was no dysdiadochokinesia. Gait was narrow and she could toe walk briefly and heel walk without difficulty.SUMMARY: Ms. A is a pleasant 72-year-old right-handed woman with a history of mesothelioma that appears stable at this time and likely mild dementia, most likely Alzheimer type. We tactfully discussed the patient's diagnosis with her, and she felt reassured. We told her that this most likely was in the earlier stages of disease and she would benefit from trying Aricept. She stated that she did not have the prescription anymore from her outpatient neurology consult for the Aricept, so we wrote her another prescription for Aricept. The patient herself seemed very concerned about the stigma of the disease, but our lengthy discussion, expressed genuine understanding as to why her outpatient physician had reported her to DMV. It was explicitly told to not drive by her outpatient neurologist and we concur with this assessment. She will follow up with us in the next six months and will call us if she has any problems with the Aricept. She was written for Aricept to start at 5 mg for three weeks, and if she has no side effects which typically are GI side effects, then she can go up to 10 mg a day. We also reviewed with Ms. A the findings for outpatient MRI, which showed some mild atrophy per report and also that her metabolic workup, which included an RPR, TSH, and B12 were all within normal limits.\nKeywords:\u00a0neurology, neurology consultation, dementing illness, alzheimer disease, dementia, alzheimer, mesothelioma,\n</patient_information>\n\nThe proposed treatment plan will be provided in these tags:\n<response>\nBased on the comprehensive clinical information provided, a reasonable treatment plan for this patient with mild Alzheimer\u2019s disease and a history of mesothelioma would include the following components:\n\n1.

Comorbid Conditions:\n   - Manage hypertension to control blood pressure (target <140/90 mm Hg).\n   - Address knee pain to improve mobility and reduce fall risk.\n   - Continue routine monitoring of metabolic parameters, including B12, TSH, and RPR, which are currently normal.\n\n6. Psychosocial and Supportive Care:\n   - Encourage regular communication with family members to improve social support.\n   - Explore community resources or adult day programs for social engagement if feasible.\n   - Discuss advance care planning and patient preferences for future care.\n\n7. Monitoring and Follow-up:\n   - Reassess cognitive function and functional status at follow-up visits.\n   - Monitor for any new neurological or psychiatric symptoms.\n   - Adjust treatment plan based on disease progression and patient preferences.\n\nThis comprehensive approach aims to optimize cognitive function, ensure safety, and support the patient\u2019s quality of life.\n</response>\n\nThe gold standard treatment plan will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nMs. A is a pleasant 72-year-old right-handed woman with a history of mesothelioma that appears stable at this time and likely mild dementia, most likely Alzheimer type. We tactfully discussed the patient's diagnosis with her, and she felt reassured. We told her that this most likely was in the earlier stages of disease and she would benefit from trying Aricept. She stated that she did not have the prescription anymore from her outpatient neurology consult for the Aricept, so we wrote her another prescription for Aricept. The patient herself seemed very concerned about the stigma of the disease, but our lengthy discussion, expressed genuine understanding as to why her outpatient physician had reported her to DMV. It was explicitly told to not drive by her outpatient neurologist and we concur with this assessment. She will follow up with us in the next six months and will call us if she has any problems with the Aricept. She was written for Aricept to start at 5 mg for three weeks, and if she has no side effects which typically are GI side effects, then she can go up to 10 mg a day. We also reviewed with Ms. A the findings for outpatient MRI, which showed some mild atrophy per report and also that her metabolic workup, which included an RPR, TSH, and B12 were all within normal limits.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully review the <response> based on the <patient_information> and compare it to the <gold_response> when needed.\n\nFor each category below, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent) and\nprovide a brief explanation for your score:\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Does the treatment plan provide correct medical advice based on clinical guidelines?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\nDoes the treatment plan include all important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the treatment plan written clearly so clinicians can easily understand it?\n\nOutput Format:\nGenerate a valid JSON object with the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n",

A V/Q scan revealed multiple pulmonary perfusion defects consistent with high probability pulmonary embolism. A Doppler venous study of the lower extremity also revealed nonocclusive right popliteal vein thrombosis. A CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed normal-appearing liver, spleen, and pancreas; however, the right kidney appeared smaller compared to left and suggesting possibility of renal infarct. Renal function on admission was within normal range; however, serial renal function showed rapid increase in creatinine to 5 today. He has been on intravenous heparin and hemodialysis is being planned for tomorrow. Reviewing his history, there is no family members with hypercoagulable state or prior history of any thrombotic complication. He denies any recent injury to his lower extremity and in fact denied any calf pain or swelling.PAST MEDICAL AND SURGICAL HISTORY: Unremarkable.SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is married and has 1 son. He has a brother who is healthy. There is no history of tobacco use or alcohol use.FAMILY HISTORY: No family history of hypercoagulable condition.\nMEDICATIONS: Advil p.r.n.ALLERGIES:  NONE.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Essentially unremarkable except for sudden onset dyspnea on easy exertion complicated with episode of syncope. He denied any hemoptysis. He denied any calf swelling or pain. Lately, he has been traveling and has been sitting behind a desk for a long period of time.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:GENERAL: He is a robust young gentleman, awake, alert, and hemodynamically stable.HEENT: Sclerae anicteric. Conjunctivae normal. Oropharynx normal.NECK: No adenopathy or thyromegaly. No jugular venous distention.\nHEART: Regular.LUNGS: Bilateral air entry.ABDOMEN: Obese and benign.EXTREMITIES: No calf swelling or calf tenderness appreciated.SKIN: No petechiae or ecchymosis.NEUROLOGIC: Nonfocal.LABORATORY FINDINGS: Blood count obtained showed a white count of 16.8, hemoglobin 14.8 g percent, hematocrit 44.6%, MCV 94, and platelet count 209,000. Liver profile normal. Thyroid study revealed a TSH of 1.3. Prothrombin time/INR 1.5, partial thromboplastin time 78.6 seconds. Renal function, BUN 44 and creatinine 5.7. Echocardiogram revealed left ventricular hypertrophy with ejection fraction of 65%, no intramural thrombus noted.IMPRESSION:\n1. Bilateral pulmonary embolism, most consistent with emboli from right lower extremity, on intravenous heparin, rule out hereditary hypercoagulable state.2.

            "explanation": "The plan correctly prioritizes ABCs, close monitoring, supportive care for overdose (including conditional use of activated charcoal), urgent psychiatric evaluation with safety measures, and confirmation of pregnancy with quantitative beta-hCG and ultrasound. These steps align with clinical guidelines. Minor misalignments include not providing evidence-based reassurance that zolpidem and tramadol are not known teratogens and suggesting discussion of termination despite the patient expressing a desire to continue the pregnancy; these are not incorrect but are slightly off-focus for this case."
